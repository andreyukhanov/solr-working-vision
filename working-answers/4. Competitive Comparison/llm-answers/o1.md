## **2\. Architecture**

Below is a summary of each engine’s architectural design. Key points include **index storage**, **clustering**, and **sharding** approaches—critical for large-scale, high-performance search.

### **2.1 Apache Solr**

* **Index Storage**: Uses Apache Lucene segment-based indexes on disk.  
* **Clustering Model**: SolrCloud manages distribution with ZooKeeper (for metadata and cluster coordination).  
* **Sharding & Replication**:  
  * Logical “collections” can be split into multiple “shards,” each shard having one or more replicas.  
  * ZooKeeper orchestrates leader election and routing of queries to the correct shard.  
* **Data Flow**: Documents flow into the indexing pipeline, are analyzed (tokenized, filtered), and written to Lucene segments. Merging segments is managed internally.  
* **Threading Model**: Java-based with multiple threading for query and indexing concurrency.

### **2.2 Elasticsearch**

* **Index Storage**: Also uses Lucene under the hood, with one or more “primary” shards plus replicas per index.  
* **Clustering Model**: Master/data node architecture with built-in cluster coordination (Zen Discovery or newer “Coordination” modules).  
* **Sharding & Replication**:  
  * Each index can be split into a user-defined number of shards, each shard can have zero or more replicas.  
  * Automatic shard rebalancing within the cluster.  
* **Data Flow**: Document indexing flows through ingest nodes (if configured), then writes to shards, which internally use Lucene segment merging.

### **2.3 OpenSearch**

* **Index Storage**: Forked from Elasticsearch, also Lucene-based.  
* **Clustering Model**: Nearly identical to older Elasticsearch 7.x architecture; separate Master and Data nodes.  
* **Sharding & Replication**:  
  * Configurable at index creation.  
  * Provides automatic rebalancing and recovery.  
* **Data Flow**: Similar ingestion pipeline to Elasticsearch, with optional plugins like Piped Processing Language (PPL), SQL, etc.

### **2.4 Sphinx**

* **Index Storage**: Maintains its own C++-based index format.  
* **Clustering Model**: Typically run as a set of distributed “searchd” daemons, plus “indexer” processes.  
* **Sharding & Replication**:  
  * Manual: you can split the data among multiple nodes or distributed indexes.  
  * Replication is not as integrated as Solr/Elasticsearch but can be done with external orchestration.  
* **Data Flow**:  
  * Batch or real-time indexing modes (rt indexes).  
  * Merges can be triggered manually or automatically, depending on configuration.

### **2.5 MeiliSearch**

* **Index Storage**: Maintains a custom Rust-based index (using “millis” for tokenization, indexing).  
* **Clustering Model**: Historically single-node oriented; cluster mode is evolving.  
* **Sharding & Replication**:  
  * Native sharding/replication is limited; typically you scale by running multiple MeiliSearch instances and using a custom load-balancer.  
* **Data Flow**:  
  * Very straightforward JSON ingestion.  
  * Offers an internal queue for asynchronous indexing operations.

### **2.6 Typesense**

* **Index Storage**: Custom in-memory index with optional persistence to disk.  
* **Clustering Model**: 3-node cluster typical; leader-follower replication for high availability.  
* **Sharding & Replication**:  
  * Automatic replication in a small cluster, but large-scale sharding is not as mature as in Solr/Elasticsearch.  
* **Data Flow**: Primarily real-time indexing. Document-based ingestion with simple schema definitions.

### **2.7 Vespa**

* **Index Storage**: Combination of on-disk and in-memory structures.  
* **Clustering Model**: Container clusters (for processing/serving) and content clusters (for storing/indexing data).  
* **Sharding & Replication**:  
  * Uses “document distribution” across content nodes; each node is responsible for a subset of the data.  
  * Automatic replication for resilience.  
* **Data Flow**: Highly configurable pipeline with support for advanced ML model execution at query or indexing time.

### **2.8 Algolia**

* **Index Storage**: Proprietary, heavily optimized C++ indexing.  
* **Clustering Model**: Fully managed SaaS with distributed data centers.  
* **Sharding & Replication**: Transparent to the end user, but effectively uses multiple replicas and shards under the hood for high availability and scaling.  
* **Data Flow**: JSON-based ingestion. Real-time indexing or batch operations via REST API or official SDKs.

* **High Availability**: Typically achieved with external orchestration.

### **3.5 MeiliSearch**

* **Recommended Scale**: More optimized for small to mid-sized datasets (up to a few tens of millions of documents) due to memory usage patterns.  
* **Sharding Efficiency**: Limited out-of-the-box. Large-scale solutions often rely on custom partitioning.  
* **High Availability**: Evolving clustering support; not as battle-tested at multi-billion document scale.

### **3.6 Typesense**

* **Recommended Scale**: Typically best for mid-sized datasets (millions to low tens of millions).  
* **Sharding Efficiency**: Basic. Typically one index per cluster node or manual distribution.  
* **High Availability**: 3-node cluster replication is straightforward, but large-scale is less typical.

### **3.7 Vespa**

* **Recommended Scale**: Designed for web-scale: Yahoo-scale billions of documents.  
* **Sharding Efficiency**: Automatic data distribution across content nodes.  
* **High Availability**: Redundant replicas and node failover built-in.  
* **Notable Strength**: Very strong for advanced, large-scale use cases combining search \+ ML \+ real-time updates.

### **3.8 Algolia**

* **Recommended Scale**: Scales well in a SaaS model, but cost can be a factor at extremely large volumes (though we’re not comparing cost).  
* **Sharding Efficiency**: Automatic in the background. Users only see an “application index” concept.  
* **High Availability**: Globally distributed data centers. Redundancy is built-in.
