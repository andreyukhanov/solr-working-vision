One can easily get lost in here. Besides the LLM answers, here are some of our thoughts.

# Elasticsearch vs Solr

Elasticsearch: easier to use (set up, scale - no ZK), operate, more polished and consistent APIs and documentation, more up-to-date with Lucene features (and in some areas more features in general), richer ecosystem
Solr: easier to extend, true open-source, larger area of applicability (e.g. batch processing and integrating other data sources via streaming aggregations, better OSS Kubernetes operator), more features that aren't behind a paywall

# OpenSearch vs Solr

Similar to Elasticsearch, but OpenSearch moved (and is moving) closer to Solr. So it is open-source now and itâ€™s easier to extend and has capabilities outside Lucene (e.g. FAISS for vector search), but itâ€™s less polished than ES (e.g. some half-baked features), worse docsâ€¦

# Vespa vs Solr

Vespa: faster searches, especially when it comes to vectors, fist-class tensor support, better integration with embedding and large language models, real-time updates and true in-place updates for doc-values-like fields (attributes). More granular scaling (distributes documents, not shards)  
Solr: easier to use and learn (yes, you read it well ðŸ™‚), easier to self-host (especially in Kubernetes), richer ecosystem, faster to autoscale in low-write scenarios (due to shareded design). Extensibility-wise theyâ€™re similar, but with Solr itâ€™s easier to take out parts that youâ€™re not interested in (e.g. you can use standalone Solr while Vespa is designed to work as a coherent piece, like Elasticsearch, although its design involves N microservices). Governance.

# Competitive Analysis Dimensions

Where does Solr stand compared to other search solutions in the following dimensions?

### Ease of use (onboarding, documentation, APIs)

Onboarding: one process, packages run everywhere. Good\! How to get started? â€¦  
Documentation: decently structured, versionedâ€¦ could be more comprehensive  
APIs: historically more disjointed but better with the v2 effort

### Features (filtering, aggregations, semantic search)

Diverse feature set (covers a lot of use-cases) and generally comprehensive.

Best in class lexical search.

Lagging on semantic search.

### Performance (indexing, queries, scalability)

Blazing fast ðŸ™‚

### Reliability

Common path \- reliable.  
Scale and customization require more attention. Less used features are less mature ðŸ™‚

### Governance (licensing model, decision making body, product vision)

Nice. Though vision/allignment is something that can be worked on.

Cathedral vs bazaar (â„¢)

### Support (ecosystem, support channels, commercial support)

Ecosystem: IDE/UI, clients, operator, ETL tools, etc. â†’ above average, but could be a lot better

### Extensibility
