## General Overview of Search Technology \[Co-Piliot\]

#### **Technical Details**

1. **Crawling**:  
   * Search engines use automated programs called **crawlers** or **spiders** to browse the web and collect information about webpages.  
   * Crawlers start with a list of known URLs and follow links on those pages to discover new ones.  
2. **Indexing**:  
   * The information collected by crawlers is stored in a vast database called an **index**.  
   * This index contains data about the content, keywords, and metadata of each webpage, making it possible to retrieve relevant results quickly.  
3. **Query Processing**:  
   * When a user enters a search query, the search engine processes it by breaking it down into individual keywords.  
   * The search engine uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the intent behind the query.  
4. **Ranking Algorithms**:  
   * Search engines use complex algorithms to determine the order of search results.  
   * Factors like keyword relevance, page quality, user behavior, and backlinks are considered in the ranking process.  
   * Machine learning models are often used to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results.  
5. **Retrieval**:  
   * The search engine retrieves the most relevant results from the index and presents them to the user.  
   * This involves generating a search engine results page (SERP) with links, snippets, and sometimes rich media content.
