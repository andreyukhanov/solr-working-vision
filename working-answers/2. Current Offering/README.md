Our comments were quite in line with the [o1 answer](llm-answers/o1.md), with the following additions:
* API support (SolrJ, Pysolr) and Environment support (Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, Windows)
* Integration/Plugins/Modules/Contributes
* Configurable update pipeline
* Highlighting, Dense Vector Search. DVS supported features:
  * KNN / Dense Vector Search
  * Query parser that takes natural language and creates embeddings via external model
  * Similarity threshold (rather than top K)
  * Feature query to calculate similarity and using it in LTR
  * Pre-filtering (during search accept or reject nodes)
  * Post-filtering
  * RRF (in PR at the time)
* Name entity recognition
* Solr Operator
* Replication Model (NRT, TLog, Pull)
* Distributed Tracing
* JWT Support
* Geo-spatial
* Auto-complete / Terms API
* Spark Solr
* CDCR, S3 Integration
