# **Apache Solr User Adoption & Retention Analysis (Last 18 Months)**

## **Executive Summary**

Apache Solr is a long-standing open-source search platform that continues to power search and analytics for major enterprises. Over the past 18 months, Solr’s core strengths – such as its rich full-text search features, faceted navigation, and reliable scalability – have sustained its appeal among its established user base. Solr’s true open-source Apache governance (with no single vendor control) also attracts organizations concerned with licensing or vendor lock-in. As a result, many large companies (e.g. Apple, Bloomberg, Salesforce) remain invested in Solr and even contribute to its development[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=depend%20on%20the%20interests%20and,moved%20on%20to%20other%20places). These factors help Solr retain a significant installed base, especially for traditional enterprise search and e-commerce applications requiring complex search functionality[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=It%20is%20pretty%20common%20for,Solr%E2%80%99s%20feature%20set%20particularly%20useful).

However, Solr faces headwinds in attracting new users. Its popularity peaked in the mid-2010s and has gradually declined as **Elasticsearch** emerged as the dominant search engine[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=The%20Grand%20Dame%20of%20open,failed%20to%20compete%20with%20Kibana)[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=Banana%20%E2%80%93%20which%20failed%20to,compete%20with%20Kibana). Today, Elasticsearch enjoys roughly four times Solr’s popularity and usage, reflecting widespread adoption across industries[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=of%20April%202025%2C%20according%20to,40)[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=This%20indicates%20that%20Elasticsearch%27s%20popularity,adoption%20in%20various%20enterprise%20applications). **OpenSearch**, a newer open-source fork of Elasticsearch backed by AWS, has been rapidly gaining traction since 2021 and is closing the gap with Solr in recent popularity rankings[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=While%20its%20popularity%20score%20is,in%20the%20next%2024%20months). *Figure 1* illustrates these trends: Solr (green line) has seen a gentle decline in popularity since 2015 while Elasticsearch (blue) remains far ahead, and OpenSearch (orange) is on a sharp upswing

. This competitive pressure, along with Solr’s own challenges (such as a more complex architecture and slower pace in adding cutting-edge features), has led many new projects to choose alternatives over Solr[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Following%20a%20continous%20decline%20in,using%20OpenSearch%20or%20other%20alternatives). Even some long-time Solr users are evaluating migrations to OpenSearch or other solutions that promise easier cloud deployment and a broader ecosystem[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/migrate-from-apache-solr-to-opensearch/#:~:text=Many%20organizations%20are%20migrating%20their,rich%20visualizations%20with%20OpenSearch%20Dashboards)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=OpenSearch%20shines%20in%20this%20regard%2C,supports%20out%20of%20the%20box).

In summary, **Apache Solr’s ability to attract new users is moderate and primarily tied to its proven feature set and open-source reliability**, while **user retention remains strong within its legacy install base due to stability and past investments**. Conversely, **Solr’s capacity to deter or dissuade potential adopters is significant** – many are drawn instead to search platforms perceived as more modern or convenient – and **user disaffection is emerging** as some existing users depart Solr for alternatives offering features or operational ease that Solr lacks. The detailed analysis below examines these factors in depth, comparing Solr’s position to relevant alternatives and providing confidence ratings for each key claim.

## **1\. User Attraction Factors**

Despite intensifying competition, Apache Solr continues to offer several features and characteristics that draw new users – particularly those with enterprise search needs – to the platform:

* **Rich Search Features and Relevance Tuning:** Solr provides powerful full-text search capabilities, faceted navigation, and extensive query options out-of-the-box. Its support for complex queries (wildcards, phrase queries, etc.), faceting for dynamic filtering, and features like result highlighting and “More Like This” queries are highly developed[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=However%2C%20Solr%20primarily%20relies%20on,in%20Solr%2C%20definitely%20worth%20checking)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20is%20not%20everything,structure%20of%20the%20returned%20documents). These capabilities make Solr especially attractive for use cases like e-commerce product search and large content repositories, where fine-grained filtering and custom relevance ranking are critical. In fact, Solr is often the **preferred choice for enterprise search applications and e-commerce platforms that require complex filtering, sorting, and hierarchical faceting** – areas where Solr’s feature set is particularly strong[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=It%20is%20pretty%20common%20for,Solr%E2%80%99s%20feature%20set%20particularly%20useful). Organizations that need these advanced search features are drawn to Solr’s proven track record in delivering relevant, tunable search results at scale.

* **Proven Scalability and Reliability:** As a mature project, Solr has demonstrated its ability to handle massive indexes and high query volumes reliably. It powers search at some of the world’s largest organizations, which is a testament to its performance and stability[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=depend%20on%20the%20interests%20and,moved%20on%20to%20other%20places). Solr’s distributed search mode (SolrCloud) supports sharding and replication for fault tolerance, ensuring high availability for mission-critical applications. These qualities attract users who prioritize a **battle-tested, stable search engine** for large-scale deployments. As one industry report noted, Solr “is still deployed on many websites and applications because it’s proven, and it simply just works”[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=Banana%20%E2%80%93%20which%20failed%20to,compete%20with%20Kibana). This reputation for reliability gives new adopters confidence that Solr can meet demanding production needs.
    * ditto, re: common to all engines, so not a factor in attraction

* **Open Source License and Community Governance:** Unlike some competitors, Solr is fully open source under the Apache 2.0 license with no licensing traps or feature paywalls. This appeals to organizations seeking to avoid vendor lock-in or licensing fees. After Elasticsearch’s 2021 license change away from Apache 2.0, Solr stands out as a **“pure” open-source search option**[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=OpenSearch). Moreover, Solr’s development is community-driven under the Apache Software Foundation, meaning no single company controls its roadmap[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=of%20providing%20some%20of%20the,of%20Solr%2C%20as%20they%20provided). This model attracts users who value transparency and community over a single vendor’s agenda. The multi-stakeholder governance also means contributors from various companies (and a dedicated Apache PMC) guide Solr’s evolution, which can reassure users that the project’s direction isn’t subject to one vendor’s commercial priorities[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=of%20providing%20some%20of%20the,of%20Solr%2C%20as%20they%20provided)[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=budget%20of%20the%20other%20engines,39%20is%20a%20longstanding%20committer). In essence, Solr’s *“open governance”* and permissive license draw in users (especially in the public sector or highly regulated industries) that require true open-source software for compliance or strategic reasons.

* **Enterprise Adoption and Ecosystem Support:** Solr has a long history and an ecosystem of tools and expertise around it. The fact that **Fortune 500 firms like Apple, Bloomberg, and Salesforce not only use Solr but also fund contributions to its codebase** is a strong signal of Solr’s capabilities[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=depend%20on%20the%20interests%20and,moved%20on%20to%20other%20places). New users are often comforted knowing that Solr is trusted at such scale. There are also established vendors and consultancies (e.g. Lucidworks, OpenSource Connections) that offer support, plugins, and training for Solr. Although Lucidworks has shifted its marketing focus in recent years, its products (and others) still build on Solr[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=Lucidworks%20were%20major%20drivers%20of,moved%20on%20to%20other%20places), meaning newcomers can find enterprise-grade support if needed. This surrounding ecosystem – from the official **Solr Reference Guide** and Solr Operator for Kubernetes, to community-maintained clients in many languages – helps attract users who need a robust search platform with available support and integrations.

* **Emerging Features (Vector Search and AI integration):** While historically a bit slower to adopt new trends, Solr’s recent versions have expanded into modern search paradigms. As of Solr 9.x, the platform supports **vector search** (dense vector fields with k-Nearest Neighbor queries) for semantic search and AI-driven applications[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=Querying%20and%20Indexing)[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=%2A%20Dense%20Vector%20,New%20NorwegianNormalizationFilter). It even introduced a *“text-to-vector”* query parser to integrate with external ML models for generating embeddings on the fly[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=Solr%20is%20the%20blazing,streaming%2C%20highlighting%2C%20faceting%2C%20and%20spellchecking)[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L158%20,is%20not%20used%20by%20default). These additions mean Solr now enables hybrid search (combining traditional keyword search with vector similarity), which can attract organizations looking to leverage AI/ML in their search solutions without abandoning Solr. Although competitors pioneered some of these capabilities, Solr’s implementation (built on Apache Lucene’s evolving vector support) provides an open alternative for neural search. **Solr’s ability to eventually catch up with new features** – even if not first – is noted by experts: it may lag initially, but over time Solr tends to implement the latest search innovations[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=I%20often%20say%20that%20even,39%20is%20a%20longstanding). For new users, this means choosing Solr is not a dead-end; the platform is actively incorporating contemporary search features (from **streaming analytics** to **geo-spatial search** and now vector semantics)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=However%2C%20Solr%20primarily%20relies%20on,in%20Solr%2C%20definitely%20worth%20checking)[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=Querying%20and%20Indexing).
    * ditto, re: common to all engines, so not a factor in attraction

In summary, Apache Solr continues to attract new users where its strengths align with requirements: **feature-rich search out-of-the-box, proven scalability, true open-source governance, and a reputation for reliability**. These attraction factors make Solr a compelling choice for enterprises needing a powerful, no-cost search engine they can tailor extensively and trust to handle large-scale, complex search applications. Solr’s recent feature upgrades (vector search, cloud-native integration via Kubernetes operators, etc.) also help in courting users who might otherwise look to newer search solutions.

## **2\. User Retention Factors**

Solr not only draws users for initial adoption, but also manages to **retain a large portion of its existing users**. Many organizations that adopted Solr years ago continue to actively use and invest in it. Key factors contributing to Solr’s user retention include:

* **Maturity and Stability in Production:** Solr’s long track record is a major reason existing users stick with it. Once Solr is deployed and tuned, it tends to run in a stable, performant manner with relatively low maintenance headaches. As one analysis noted, Solr “simply just works” for many existing deployments[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=Banana%20%E2%80%93%20which%20failed%20to,compete%20with%20Kibana). This operational dependability means there is little urgency for users to replace Solr if it’s meeting their needs. In scenarios like enterprise content management search or e-commerce sites, Solr often has been running for years, proving its reliability through countless queries. That accumulated trust and familiarity encourages organizations to continue using Solr rather than risk a disruptive migration. The **cost of switching** to a different engine (in terms of reindexing data, reimplementing search logic, retraining staff, etc.) can be significant, so the inertia of a stable Solr installation works in Solr’s favor when it comes to retention.

* **Deep Integration and Legacy Investments:** Many enterprises have built extensive tooling, business logic, and data pipelines around Solr. For example, they may have custom analyzers, ingestion processes, or search UIs tightly coupled to Solr’s APIs. Over the past decade, Solr became a backbone for search in numerous enterprises. These organizations often have **significant legacy investments** – not only in Solr itself, but in the knowledge and custom code surrounding it. As a result, they are inclined to continue with Solr to leverage these existing assets. Industry consultants observe that **larger enterprises and corporations are more likely to be using Solr today mostly for historical reasons** – they adopted it years ago and have not switched because it still fulfills their requirements[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Following%20a%20continous%20decline%20in,using%20OpenSearch%20or%20other%20alternatives). In essence, Solr’s installed base persists because it is deeply embedded in workflows and products. Companies prefer to “don’t fix what isn’t broken,” especially when Solr’s performance is adequate. This retention factor is reinforced by the availability of support options (e.g. OpenLogic, HeroDevs, or independent Solr experts) that enable companies to maintain Solr for the long term, even as official support for older versions (like Solr 8.x) has ended[herodevs.com](https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/never-ending-support-for-apache-solr-lucene-maintain-performance-while-minimizing-risk#:~:text=Official%20support%20for%20Solr%20%26,stability%2C%20without%20forcing%20costly%20migrations)[herodevs.com](https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/never-ending-support-for-apache-solr-lucene-maintain-performance-while-minimizing-risk#:~:text=What%20HeroDevs%20Offers).

* **Feature Completeness and Customizability:** Solr’s users often take advantage of its broad feature set and flexibility, making switching difficult. Over years of use, an organization might utilize Solr’s advanced capabilities – such as **complex relevancy tuning with function queries, custom scoring plugins, facet pivots, streaming expressions for analytics, and integration with Apache ZooKeeper for configuration**. Solr offers multiple ways to achieve outcomes (sometimes “5 different options” for a given task, as an expert quipped[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=Solr%20is%20a%20lumbering%20beast,many%20of%20which)), which allowed existing users to tailor it precisely to their needs. This flexibility becomes a retention asset: users have configured Solr in specialized ways that might not be easily replicated in another engine. For instance, an e-commerce company might have fine-tuned Solr’s synonym handling, multilingual analyzers, and result boosting to perfectly serve their domain – porting all those relevance tweaks to a new system would be non-trivial. Thus, Solr’s very richness and customizability tie users to it, because they have a solution that works and is highly adapted to their use case.

* **Continuing Evolution within the Solr Project:** Existing users are reassured by the fact that Solr is still under active development (despite perceptions to the contrary). The Apache Solr community has delivered steady releases (Solr 9.x series in 2023–2025) with improvements and new features that benefit incumbent users. For example, **Solr 9 introduced significant enhancements** like improved scalability (node roles, better autoscaling through placement plugins) and security features[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=Stability%20and%20Scalability)[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=,without%20relying%20on%20the%20Overseer). Subsequent minor releases added capabilities such as cross-data-center replication support, refined cloud deployment on Kubernetes, and the above-mentioned vector search integration[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=Solr%20is%20the%20blazing,streaming%2C%20highlighting%2C%20faceting%2C%20and%20spellchecking)[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L158%20,is%20not%20used%20by%20default). This ongoing progress helps retain users by addressing pain points and keeping Solr reasonably up-to-date. A current Solr user can see that the platform is not abandonware – Lucene (Solr’s core library) has even reached version 10 in late 2024, and Solr itself continues to benefit from Lucene’s advancements and community contributions[herodevs.com](https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/apache-solr-lucene-in-2025-community-momentum-and-release-cadence#:~:text=Apache%20Solr%20%26%20Lucene%20in,Solr%20continues)[blog.released.info](https://blog.released.info/2024/11/01/apache-solr.html#:~:text=Exploring%20New%20Features%20in%20Recent,with%20new%20features%20improving%20scalability). Active users often participate in the Solr community (mailing lists, GitHub) and thus have a say in the roadmap, which further increases loyalty. The sentiment is that **“it’s not going away any time soon,”** and many organizations are confident investing in Solr for the future[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=budget%20of%20the%20other%20engines,39%20is%20a%20longstanding%20committer). This confidence in Solr’s longevity and momentum (however modest compared to Elastic) is a key factor preventing churn.

* **Open Source Commitment and Control:** Companies that prioritize open-source solutions tend to stick with Solr for philosophical and practical reasons. With Solr, users have full control of the software – they can modify the source, deploy anywhere, and avoid being at the mercy of a vendor’s business decisions. This is a retention factor particularly after competitors introduced restrictions (e.g. Elastic’s license change). Some organizations doubled down on Solr because it remained Apache-licensed, ensuring they wouldn’t face unexpected licensing costs or usage limitations. As an example, when Elastic moved to a non-OSI license, **OpenSearch was created to preserve an open-source path**[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=First%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20address%20the%20elephant,Elasticsearch%20as%20a%20Managed%20Service)[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=This%20licensing%20change%20prompted%20the,as%20a%20replacement%20for%20Elasticsearch), but many users already on Solr viewed Solr as an even more mature open alternative without such licensing drama. Solr’s model of diverse committership from many firms gives users confidence that no single vendor can suddenly change course; this collective stewardship is seen as a **strength that keeps risk-averse users on Solr**[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=of%20providing%20some%20of%20the,of%20Solr%2C%20as%20they%20provided)[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=Diverging%20from%20its%20original%20parent%2C,to%20invest%20significantly%20in%20the). Additionally, long-time Solr users often become part of the community themselves, contributing patches or plugins. This sense of ownership and community involvement can reinforce their commitment to the platform.

In summary, **Solr retains users by virtue of working well for them and being deeply integrated into their systems**. Its stability, the sunk costs in Solr expertise/infrastructure, its rich feature set, and the assurance of continued open-source support all create a high barrier to exit. Many enterprises using Solr “understand the strength of the pure open source model” and are happy to continue with it, as exemplified by clients who use Solr “quite happily” and even contribute to its development[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=there%20will%20be%20talks%20about,39%20is%20a%20longstanding%20committer). Unless a compelling reason arises, these users have more to lose than gain by switching, so they remain loyal to Solr for the foreseeable future.

## **3\. User Deterrence Factors**

While Solr’s existing users appreciate its benefits, many **potential new users are deterred from adopting Solr** in the current landscape. Over the last 18 months, several factors have limited Solr’s ability to attract *additional* or modern projects, especially when compared to alternative search solutions:

* **Complex, Aging Architecture (Operational Overhead):** One of the primary deterrents is Solr’s more complex deployment and maintenance model. To run Solr in a distributed, highly available setup (SolrCloud), one must also run **Apache ZooKeeper** as an external coordination service. This adds operational burden – deploying and managing a ZooKeeper ensemble – which newer users often balk at. In contrast, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch have cluster coordination built-in, with no extra moving parts. Many organizations favor technologies that are cloud-native and easy to deploy; Solr’s reliance on ZooKeeper (and generally heavier configuration) is seen as a remnant of older design. AWS explicitly cites *“elimination of external cluster managers like Zookeeper”* as a benefit of moving from Solr to OpenSearch[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/migrate-from-apache-solr-to-opensearch/#:~:text=Many%20organizations%20are%20migrating%20their,rich%20visualizations%20with%20OpenSearch%20Dashboards). The need to manually handle shards, replicas, config files (e.g. solr.xml, schema definitions) and other tuning in Solr can deter users who prefer the more **automated, turnkey setup** of alternatives. Modern DevOps trends (containers, Kubernetes) also highlight Solr’s relative clunkiness – although Solr has a Kubernetes Operator available, it’s a separate component, whereas OpenSearch was “built with cloud-native deployments in mind” and simplifies K8s via dedicated operators and Terraform providers[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Solr%20can%20be%20deployed%20in,and%20management%20in%20this%20environment)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=OpenSearch%20was%20designed%20with%20cloud,provides%20a%20dedicated%20Terraform%20provider). For new projects with limited ops resources, Solr’s steeper learning curve in cluster management is a strong disincentive.

* **Less Developer-Friendly APIs and Ecosystem:** Developers often cite that Solr feels less approachable than its competitors. Solr’s original API and query syntax (the “Solr query parser” with a schema-driven approach) can seem arcane, involving XML/HTTP parameters or rigid JSON documents defined by a static schema. Although Solr later introduced a more modern JSON API, **Elasticsearch’s JSON-based query DSL and schema-less indexing gained a reputation for being more intuitive and flexible**[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=OpenSearch%2C%20on%20the%20other%20hand%2C,the%20results%20of%20the%20queries)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=OpenSearch%2C%20by%20contrast%2C%20inherits%20Elasticsearch%E2%80%99s,invested%20in%20the%20Elasticsearch%20ecosystem). OpenSearch inherits that developer-friendly API. A team evaluating search engines today may lean towards Elastic/OpenSearch because developers can get started faster: index documents without predefining every field (dynamic mapping), and construct queries via JSON objects (which align well with modern programming practices and REST usage)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=OpenSearch%2C%20by%20contrast%2C%20inherits%20Elasticsearch%E2%80%99s,invested%20in%20the%20Elasticsearch%20ecosystem). By comparison, Solr’s requirement (in many cases) to manually define schemas (**comment: not true**), analyzers, and use a sometimes verbose API can deter adoption by agile teams or those newer to search technology. Additionally, the **rich tooling ecosystem around Elasticsearch** – like Kibana for visualization, Beats/Logstash for ingestion, and many client libraries – means a smoother developer experience for building a full search stack. Solr’s ecosystem is comparatively sparse (no first-party equivalent to Kibana or Logstash; users tried community projects like Banana for dashboards, which “failed to compete with Kibana”[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=in%202003%20and%20became%20hugely,failed%20to%20compete%20with%20Kibana)[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=victim%20of%20the%20growing%20popularity,failed%20to%20compete%20with%20Kibana)). Potential users seeking an integrated analytics dashboard or easy data ingestion pipelines out-of-the-box may be put off by Solr, which would require assembling third-party tools or custom solutions for those capabilities.

* **Perception of Being Outdated or Losing Popularity:** Solr’s brand has suffered somewhat from the narrative that “Elasticsearch replaced Solr as the most popular open source search engine” years ago[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=The%20Grand%20Dame%20of%20open,failed%20to%20compete%20with%20Kibana). This perception matters: engineers and technical decision-makers often gravitate to what’s considered the current standard. **Elasticsearch is the “default” choice for many developers** entering the search space, with OpenSearch increasingly in the conversation as a fully open alternative. Solr, in contrast, is sometimes viewed as legacy technology – the *“old dog”* in open-source search, as one commentator put it[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=I%E2%80%99ve%20had%20some%20interesting%20conversations,any%20on%20their%20last%20legs)[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=Solr%20is%20the%20old%20dog,who%20would%20come%20out%20with). Newcomers might equate Solr with older Java enterprise software, whereas Elastic feels aligned with modern use cases like log analytics, observability, etc. Indeed, **new cloud-native projects rarely pick Solr**: recent industry observations note a *“continuous decline in Solr adoption in recent years,”* with smaller companies and greenfield projects tending to choose OpenSearch or other alternatives instead[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Following%20a%20continous%20decline%20in,using%20OpenSearch%20or%20other%20alternatives). This momentum shift creates a network effect deterrent – fewer new community contributions, plugins or online discussions revolve around Solr now compared to Elastic/OS, making Solr less attractive to adopt fresh. It’s notable that Solr’s popularity score on DB-Engines has been trending downward, whereas OpenSearch’s is rising[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=While%20its%20popularity%20score%20is,in%20the%20next%2024%20months). For risk-averse project leaders, betting on a seemingly declining platform is a tough sell, further deterring new adoption.

* **Lag in Cutting-Edge Features (Vector Search, ML Integration):** Although Solr has begun to add vector search capabilities, it’s generally seen as **lagging behind the innovation curve** set by competitors. Elasticsearch (and its fork OpenSearch) moved quickly to incorporate features like native vector similarity search, anomaly detection, and built-in machine learning plugins (in Elastic’s case) over the past few years. Solr’s development, being community-driven and consensus-based, proceeds more slowly and without the marketing fanfare. As Charlie Hull noted in 2024, *“Solr lags a little in providing some of the latest vector-powered AI features.”*[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=Solr%20is%20a%20lumbering%20beast,many%20of%20which)[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=something%20,and%20Salesforce%20all%20adopting%20it) This has deterred organizations working on cutting-edge search applications (such as semantic search, AI chatbots needing Retrieval Augmented Generation, etc.) from choosing Solr – they often opt for Elastic, OpenSearch or specialized vector databases that had those capabilities earlier. Even though Solr 9+ supports dense vectors and k-NN search, the **mindshare for AI-driven search** has largely coalesced around other tools (including emerging vector search engines like Vespa, Weaviate, Pinecone, etc., which explicitly target AI use cases)[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=The%20question%20%E2%80%98which%20is%20the,even%20outside%20the%20Lucene%20ecosystem)[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=the%20rest%20of%20the%20menagerie,even%20outside%20the%20Lucene%20ecosystem). If a new project’s requirements emphasize AI/ML integration or advanced analytics, they might be deterred from Solr by a (now perhaps outdated) belief that “Solr can’t do that yet” or that its implementations are experimental. The community’s smaller size also means fewer out-of-the-box ML model integrations compared to Elastic’s ecosystem. In short, **Solr’s slower feature development cycle and lower hype in trending areas (like vectors, cloud monitoring)** cause some potential users to dismiss it as not future-proof for their needs, even if that perception isn’t entirely accurate with the latest releases.

* **Limited Managed Services and Cloud Offerings:** In today’s cloud-first IT environment, the availability of easy managed services can heavily influence technology adoption. Elasticsearch has **Elastic Cloud** and is also offered (in various forms) on AWS, GCP, and Azure. OpenSearch is provided as a first-party **Amazon OpenSearch Service** on AWS. In contrast, Apache Solr does not have an equivalent ubiquitous managed cloud service by a major provider. This lack of one-click cloud hosting options is a deterrent for users who do not want to run their own search servers. While there are smaller vendors and open-source operators, the absence of Solr on, say, AWS Marketplace as a fully managed, scalable service means many cloud-focused teams won’t consider it. In fact, AWS’s move to promote OpenSearch was partly because they *“can no longer offer Elasticsearch as a managed service”* due to license changes[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=First%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20address%20the%20elephant,Elasticsearch%20as%20a%20Managed%20Service)[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=This%20licensing%20change%20prompted%20the,as%20a%20replacement%20for%20Elasticsearch) – and Solr was not picked up as an alternative likely because of its operational complexity. Consequently, organizations already all-in on cloud services see OpenSearch (or proprietary services like Azure Cognitive Search, Algolia, etc.) as the path of least resistance for search, not Solr. The **convenience and lower operational cost** of these services deters adoption of Solr, which would require self-managing clusters (with associated expertise). Even those committed to open source may prefer OpenSearch simply because it has a big cloud vendor (AWS) backing it with easy deployment. This dynamic has stunted Solr’s new user growth in cloud-centric startups and agile teams.

* **Smaller Community and Uncertain Support Perception:** Finally, potential adopters may be deterred by concerns about the vitality of Solr’s community and support. With Elastic (the company) investing heavily in developer relations and AWS similarly pushing OpenSearch, Solr’s community activity is comparatively lower-profile. The **decline of Lucidworks’ visible involvement** (they no longer emphasize Solr in their marketing[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=Lucidworks%20were%20major%20drivers%20of,moved%20on%20to%20other%20places)) and the fact that some prominent Solr committers have moved on could raise questions for newcomers about the project’s sustainability. While the project is indeed active, this external perception matters. A new evaluator might notice that Solr has fewer GitHub stars or Slack/forum activity than Elastic/OS and interpret that as a risk of less help or slower issue resolution. Additionally, official support for older Solr versions has ended (as of October 2024 for the Solr 8.x line[herodevs.com](https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/never-ending-support-for-apache-solr-lucene-maintain-performance-while-minimizing-risk#:~:text=organizations%20to%20security%20vulnerabilities%20and,compliance%20risks)[herodevs.com](https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/never-ending-support-for-apache-solr-lucene-maintain-performance-while-minimizing-risk#:~:text=Official%20support%20for%20Solr%20%26,stability%2C%20without%20forcing%20costly%20migrations)), which might deter users who are not prepared to upgrade frequently or who worry about long-term support. In contrast, Elastic’s paid support or OpenSearch’s backing by AWS/Linux Foundation might seem more reassuring. **In summary, the relative quiet around Solr in the broader tech discourse – fewer tutorials, fewer conference talks than Elastic, etc. – can discourage new users**, who may feel “if others aren’t adopting it, why should we?”
  * All offerings sunset versions, presumably? It'd be interesting to see whether Solr is more or less generous than Elastic, OpenSearch, et al on this.

Overall, these deterrence factors have significantly influenced Solr’s adoption trend in the last 18 months. Solr often ends up being passed over in favor of alternatives that are perceived as easier to manage, more modern, or more popular. Unless an organization specifically needs Solr’s unique strengths, the **barriers of complexity, an aging image, and stronger competitors’ offerings tend to steer new users away** from Apache Solr in 2024–2025.

## **4\. User Disaffection Factors**

In addition to challenges in attracting new users, Apache Solr faces **risks of disaffection among its current user base**. Some long-time Solr users have grown dissatisfied or found reasons to scale back their usage of Solr, potentially migrating to other solutions. Key factors causing existing users to abandon or reduce their use of Solr include:

* **Concerns About Future Innovation and Roadmap:** A number of Solr users have become anxious about Solr’s ability to keep pace with rapidly evolving search technology. Even though Solr is actively developed, the project’s roadmap and feature releases can feel slow relative to user needs. For instance, the rise of AI-driven search and vector databases has outpaced Solr’s implementations. As noted, Solr only recently added vector search support, leading some users who needed that capability earlier to adopt other tools. A 2023 industry report observed that **developers may worry Solr “can’t keep pace with the latest innovations,” and as a result the rate of new Solr implementations could be overtaken by migrations to alternatives**[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=Banana%20%E2%80%93%20which%20failed%20to,compete%20with%20Kibana). This sentiment can infect existing deployments too: teams might start evaluating a move to Elastic/OpenSearch if they feel Solr is lagging in, say, machine learning integration, or if they see other companies benefiting from features Solr lacks. Essentially, a fear of missing out on new tech (like better vector search, automatic relevancy tuning tools, etc.) can cause disaffection. If Solr’s roadmap doesn’t publicly emphasize these innovations, some users will proactively jump ship to ensure their search platform doesn’t become a bottleneck to progress.

* **Availability of Viable Open Alternatives (OpenSearch):** Ironically, the same open-source ethos that kept some users on Solr is now giving them another place to go. **OpenSearch has emerged as a compelling alternative for users who want to remain in an open-source ecosystem but seek more features or easier operations**. As OpenSearch matures (diverging from Elasticsearch with its own improvements and a growing community), some Solr users have been tempted to migrate to OpenSearch. This is especially true for those already on AWS or those whose use cases align with OpenSearch’s strengths (e.g. log analytics with built-in Kibana-like dashboards). A guide on migrating from Solr to OpenSearch notes *“growing interest in cloud-native platforms like Amazon OpenSearch Service”* and outlines steps for Solr users to transition[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2021/01/21/migrate-to-solr-or-elasticsearch/#:~:text=featured%20in%20our%20talk%20The,Search%20Engine%20Migration%20Circus)[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/migrate-from-apache-solr-to-opensearch/#:~:text=Many%20organizations%20are%20migrating%20their,rich%20visualizations%20with%20OpenSearch%20Dashboards). The drivers include reduced TCO, no ZooKeeper, better ingestion and visualization – all factors we discussed as Solr drawbacks. The fact that such migration guides and tools exist (and are being promoted by major players) indicates a portion of Solr’s user base is indeed peeling off. OpenSearch’s momentum (jumping from \#8 to \#4 in search engine popularity within a year[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=While%20its%20popularity%20score%20is,in%20the%20next%2024%20months)) partly comes from drawing some long-time Solr users who finally see a comfortable place to land without going closed-source. Over the last 18 months, this trend has accelerated as OpenSearch proved itself stable and as organizations sought to modernize their search infrastructure.

* **Shift in Logging/Analytics Use Cases to Specialized Stacks:** Solr historically was used not just for text search, but also for log and event data analysis (Solr could index logs, and tools like Apache Banana tried to replicate the ELK stack with Solr). However, **in the logging/observability domain, the ELK/OpenSearch stacks have become de facto standards**, and Splunk remains a heavyweight for enterprise logging. Many organizations that might have used Solr for analytics in the past have since moved to these specialized solutions that come with rich visualization (Kibana/OpenSearch Dashboards) and integrations. Even some who previously ran Solr for log search have migrated to OpenSearch for a smoother experience. As Pureinsights noted, attempts to build an ELK-equivalent around Solr “failed to compete with Kibana,” and Elastic made significant inroads in log analytics[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=in%202003%20and%20became%20hugely,failed%20to%20compete%20with%20Kibana). Thus, any Solr deployments that were focused on logs or metrics have a high chance of being deprecated in favor of Elastic or OpenSearch. This causes a *gradual attrition* of Solr usage in that particular sector of use. It’s a disaffection driven not by Solr’s failings per se, but by other solutions excelling in those scenarios.

* **Operational Frustrations and Scaling Limitations:** Some existing users, after years of running Solr, have accumulated pain points related to scaling and maintenance. For example, Solr’s cluster scaling can require manual shard splitting or replica rebalancing, which is labor-intensive. As data sizes grow exponentially, these manual interventions become a burden. Meanwhile, Elasticsearch’s design of automatically distributing shards (and OpenSearch’s managed services) can handle scaling more gracefully. If a Solr cluster experiences outages or difficult recovery scenarios (e.g. ZooKeeper issues causing cluster state inconsistencies), the team running it might grow disaffected and explore alternatives. **The AWS blog on migrating Solr to OpenSearch explicitly cites “stability” and easier scalability as reasons organizations move**[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/migrate-from-apache-solr-to-opensearch/#:~:text=Many%20organizations%20are%20migrating%20their,rich%20visualizations%20with%20OpenSearch%20Dashboards). An existing Solr user who has hit such issues might conclude that the grass is greener with a different engine that promises “hands-off” scaling. Furthermore, performance comparisons (like one report noting Elasticsearch handled slightly more requests/sec with lower latency than Solr in a benchmark[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=%E2%80%8D)[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=,580%20requests%2Fsec%20with%2053ms%20latency)) can convince users that they could get better efficiency by switching. In summary, the *operational toil* and any perceived performance plateau with Solr can drive previously happy users to become dissatisfied and consider replacements that reduce operational complexity (even if those come with other trade-offs, like potentially higher cost or different quirks).

* **Dwindling Vendor Support and Community Signals:** As mentioned, the ecosystem around Solr has shifted. Lucidworks, once the primary commercial supporter of Solr, has pivoted to promoting its own applications (Fusion, etc.) and cloud offerings, with less emphasis on Solr itself[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=Lucidworks%20were%20major%20drivers%20of,moved%20on%20to%20other%20places). This leaves some enterprises wondering where to get expert help. While a community remains, the lack of a prominent, Solr-focused company providing new features or driving marketing can cause a psychological downturn in user confidence. Charlie Hull’s wish in late 2024 for *“a new, well-funded, well-led company hosting and supporting Solr”* underscores this gap[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=I%20had%20a%20chat%20with,foundation%20for%20AI%20%E2%80%93%20you). In practical terms, if an existing Solr user doesn’t see a clear vendor-backed roadmap or they struggle to hire Solr talent (because more engineers are learning Elastic/OS now), they might feel compelled to move to a solution with a larger talent pool and commercial backing. There’s also the factor of community plugins and integrations: if these start to stagnate for Solr, users may leave to avoid being left with unsupported components. All these are subtle disaffection drivers that accumulate over time – essentially, **users can lose faith that Solr is the strategic choice going forward**, even if it served them well in the past.

* **Evolution of Needs (Beyond Search):** Some use cases that began purely as search have expanded into broader analytics, requiring capabilities beyond Solr’s scope (like business intelligence dashboards, real-time metrics aggregation, etc.). Rather than keep Solr alongside another system, organizations might consolidate on a single solution that can do search *and* analytics. Elastic’s expansion into observability and security (SIEM) via the Elastic Stack is one example; Splunk’s evolution is another. If an organization’s needs grow beyond what Solr comfortably delivers (for instance, needing extensive aggregations or alerting), they might retire Solr in favor of a platform that addresses the full range of requirements. This isn’t a knock on Solr’s search ability, but a reflection that modern data platforms are converging capabilities. Solr does have some analytic features (e.g. JSON facet aggregations, streaming expressions for parallel computations), but these are lesser known and less user-friendly than, say, writing Kibana queries or using a SQL-on-index feature in OpenSearch. Consequently, existing Solr deployments can be phased out during a broader tech stack modernization – not because Solr failed at search, but because the organization chose a different route to cover search and analytics together.

In sum, **user disaffection with Solr stems from a combination of push factors (limitations or frustrations with Solr itself) and pull factors (compelling reasons to move to alternatives)**. Over the last 18 months, we’ve seen a notable uptick in Solr-to-OpenSearch migrations and a gradual shedding of Solr in environments that pivot to the ELK/OpenSearch stack or other search technologies. It’s important to note that Solr still retains a core of contented users, as discussed in retention factors – but the above points highlight why some of those users eventually decide to leave. As one search expert succinctly put it, **Solr might not be “on its last legs” yet[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=I%E2%80%99ve%20had%20some%20interesting%20conversations,any%20on%20their%20last%20legs), but the rate of new Solr usage is shrinking while migrations away are slowly nibbling at its market share**[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=Banana%20%E2%80%93%20which%20failed%20to,compete%20with%20Kibana). Addressing these disaffection factors (e.g. simplifying operations, loudly communicating new features, fostering a stronger support ecosystem) will be crucial if Solr is to keep its current users fully engaged in the long run.

## **5\. Confidence Ratings for Key Claims**

Each major claim in the above analysis is given a confidence rating (High, Medium, or Low) based on the quality of supporting evidence and the consistency of reports from multiple sources:

* **Solr continues to draw users for its advanced search features and open-source model – *Confidence: High*.** This claim is backed by multiple sources noting Solr’s strong faceted search, full-text capabilities, and appeal to enterprises valuing Apache licensing[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=It%20is%20pretty%20common%20for,Solr%E2%80%99s%20feature%20set%20particularly%20useful)[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=budget%20of%20the%20other%20engines,39%20is%20a%20longstanding%20committer). There is broad agreement in industry literature that Solr’s functionality in those areas is a key attraction, lending high confidence to this assertion.

* **Many large organizations are sticking with Solr due to its reliability and existing investments – *Confidence: High*.** Sources consistently report that Solr remains in widespread use at major companies and that it “simply works” in production[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=Banana%20%E2%80%93%20which%20failed%20to,compete%20with%20Kibana)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Following%20a%20continous%20decline%20in,using%20OpenSearch%20or%20other%20alternatives). The convergence of expert opinions and case examples (Apple, Bloomberg, etc.) provides strong evidence, so we are highly confident in this retention factor.

* **New projects today rarely choose Solr, favoring Elasticsearch or OpenSearch – *Confidence: High*.** Both quantitative data (DB-Engines trends, popularity scores) and qualitative expert commentary confirm a decline in Solr adoption and a rise in OpenSearch[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Following%20a%20continous%20decline%20in,using%20OpenSearch%20or%20other%20alternatives)[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=While%20its%20popularity%20score%20is,in%20the%20next%2024%20months). The alignment of statistics with industry observations yields high confidence that Solr is not attracting many new users relative to alternatives.

* **Solr’s requirement of ZooKeeper and manual upkeep deters potential users – *Confidence: High*.** This specific point is well-documented in comparisons and migration guides[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/migrate-from-apache-solr-to-opensearch/#:~:text=Many%20organizations%20are%20migrating%20their,rich%20visualizations%20with%20OpenSearch%20Dashboards)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Solr%20can%20be%20deployed%20in,and%20management%20in%20this%20environment). It’s a commonly cited disadvantage of Solr, mentioned by authoritative sources (AWS, consultants), therefore confidence is high.

* **Existing Solr users are beginning to migrate to OpenSearch due to features and ease-of-use – *Confidence: Medium*.** There is solid anecdotal and advisory evidence (e.g. blog guides on migrating[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2021/01/21/migrate-to-solr-or-elasticsearch/#:~:text=featured%20in%20our%20talk%20The,Search%20Engine%20Migration%20Circus) and OpenSearch’s rising usage[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=While%20its%20popularity%20score%20is,in%20the%20next%2024%20months)) suggesting this trend, but exact numbers of migrations are not publicly available. The evidence is suggestive but not comprehensive, so we assign medium confidence – the trend is likely real, but specific magnitude is hard to quantify.

* **Solr’s perceived lag in new features (like AI/vector search) contributes to user dissatisfaction – *Confidence: Medium*.** We have expert commentary noting this lag[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=something%20,and%20Salesforce%20all%20adopting%20it) and reports of concern among developers[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=Banana%20%E2%80%93%20which%20failed%20to,compete%20with%20Kibana). However, since Solr has indeed added vector capabilities, the extent of this perception may vary by user. We have moderate confidence that this factor is causing some disaffection, supported by sources but not universally quantified.

* **Elasticsearch’s popularity (4x Solr’s) demonstrates Solr’s minority position – *Confidence: High*.** This is directly supported by up-to-date popularity scores from DB-Engines[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=of%20April%202025%2C%20according%20to,40) and is an objective metric. Confidence is high because the data is concrete and from a reliable industry index.

* **Solr retains a core niche for enterprise search and e-commerce use cases – *Confidence: High*.** Multiple sources identify those domains as Solr’s stronghold[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=It%20is%20pretty%20common%20for,Solr%E2%80%99s%20feature%20set%20particularly%20useful)[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=1,Although%20Solr%E2%80%99s%20schemas%20can). The consistency of that narrative across different authors gives high confidence that Solr remains valued in those niches, even as general popularity slips.

* **Lack of a major cloud managed service for Solr is a significant adoption barrier – *Confidence: High*.** This claim is supported by the conspicuous absence of Solr in cloud providers’ offerings (noted in sources like nine.ch[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=Choosing%20the%20Right%20Search%20Engine)) and by contrast with how OpenSearch came to fill that gap[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=This%20licensing%20change%20prompted%20the,as%20a%20replacement%20for%20Elasticsearch). Given the logical and evidenced nature of this point, we have high confidence in its validity.

* **Solr’s community momentum is lower now, which worries some users – *Confidence: Medium*.** We have qualitative input (e.g. Hull’s blog mentioning committers moving on and a desire for new corporate sponsorship[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=Lucidworks%20were%20major%20drivers%20of,moved%20on%20to%20other%20places)[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=I%20had%20a%20chat%20with,foundation%20for%20AI%20%E2%80%93%20you)). While these are credible observations, they are somewhat subjective. We haven’t seen a formal survey of user sentiment on this, hence medium confidence – it’s plausible and supported by expert opinion, but not rigorously measured.

Each of the above ratings reflects how strongly the current evidence supports the claim. Overall, the most crucial claims about Solr’s position (declining new adoption, strong legacy use, reasons for deterrence like complexity, etc.) are supported with **high confidence** due to multiple converging data points. More nuanced or forward-looking claims (like the extent of user migration or morale) we rate with **medium confidence**, acknowledging some uncertainty. There were no major claims in our analysis with only low confidence; we avoided speculation and focused on well-substantiated points.

## **6\. Evidence Sources**

1. **Charlie Hull, OpenSource Connections – "Dogfights in Open Source Search: Solr, OpenSearch and Elasticsearch" (Oct 2024):** An expert consultant’s comparison of Solr, Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch, discussing their histories, communities, and futures[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=something%20,and%20Salesforce%20all%20adopting%20it)[opensourceconnections.com](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2024/10/10/dogfights-in-open-source-search-solr-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/#:~:text=depend%20on%20the%20interests%20and,moved%20on%20to%20other%20places). Hull provides insight into Solr’s strengths (open governance, big users) and weaknesses (lags in AI features, loss of single-company backing), which informed our attraction and deterrence analysis.

2. **BigData Boutique – "Apache Solr vs OpenSearch: Comparison and Key Differences" (Jan 2025):** A blog from search consultants contrasting Solr and OpenSearch[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=OpenSearch%20shines%20in%20this%20regard%2C,supports%20out%20of%20the%20box)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Following%20a%20continous%20decline%20in,using%20OpenSearch%20or%20other%20alternatives). It notes Solr’s adoption decline and OpenSearch’s rise, as well as technical differences (cloud-native ease, etc.), supporting points on deterrence (for new users) and the shift in preferred solutions for new projects.

3. **AWS Big Data Blog – "Migrate from Apache Solr to OpenSearch" (July 2024):** Amazon’s guide for Solr users migrating to AWS OpenSearch Service[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/migrate-from-apache-solr-to-opensearch/#:~:text=Many%20organizations%20are%20migrating%20their,rich%20visualizations%20with%20OpenSearch%20Dashboards). It explicitly lists drivers for migration: lower cost, no ZooKeeper, better ingestion, and visualization tools. This is key evidence of both deterrence (barriers of Solr) and disaffection (actual migrations happening).

4. **Pureinsights – "Search Engine Rankings 2023" (Aug 2023):** Industry blog analyzing DB-Engines popularity rankings for search engines[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=The%20Grand%20Dame%20of%20open,failed%20to%20compete%20with%20Kibana)[pureinsights.com](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2023/search-engine-rankings-2023/#:~:text=Banana%20%E2%80%93%20which%20failed%20to,compete%20with%20Kibana). It confirms Elasticsearch’s dominance, Solr’s peak in 2015 followed by decline, and OpenSearch’s momentum (from \#8 to \#4). These data underpin our statements about popularity trends and user mindshare.

5. **Zymr Inc. – "Solr vs. Elasticsearch: Introductory Comparison" (Apr 2025):** A technology consulting blog that compares Solr and Elasticsearch for enterprise search[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=of%20April%202025%2C%20according%20to,40)[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=Elasticsearch%20is%20a%20distributed%2C%20RESTful,scale%20data%20applications). It provides current DB-Engines scores (Elasticsearch \~128 vs Solr \~32) and discusses core features, use cases, and even a performance anecdote. We used this to highlight the popularity gap and feature comparisons in attraction/retention factors.

6. **Nine.ch – "Comparing Solr, Elasticsearch and OpenSearch" (May 2024):** A managed services provider’s blog covering differences between the three engines[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=Apache%20Solr%20has%20a%20longer,more%20popular%20than%20Apache%20Solr)[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20seem%20to%20be,Elasticsearch%20as%20a%20Managed%20Service). It mentions the effect of Elastic’s licensing (leading to OpenSearch), notes that prior experience often guides choice (suggesting established Solr users stick with Solr), and confirms Elasticsearch’s greater popularity as of 2024\. It also provided the DB-Engines trend chart we embedded, illustrating the relative trajectories【30†】.

7. **Apache Solr Reference (Official News and Release Notes) 2022–2025:** The Apache Solr website’s news section, which documents release highlights[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=Querying%20and%20Indexing)[solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/news.html#:~:text=%2A%20New%20,the%20Prometheus%20Exporter%20as%20well). This source verified Solr’s introduction of features like vector search and cross-data-center replication, giving factual backing to claims that Solr is evolving (attraction/retention) albeit a bit later than rivals (which ties to deterrence/disaffection for cutting-edge needs).

8. **HeroDevs – "Never-Ending Support for Apache Solr & Lucene" (Mar 2025):** A blog post by a firm offering extended support for Solr 8.x[herodevs.com](https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/never-ending-support-for-apache-solr-lucene-maintain-performance-while-minimizing-risk#:~:text=organizations%20to%20security%20vulnerabilities%20and,compliance%20risks)[herodevs.com](https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/never-ending-support-for-apache-solr-lucene-maintain-performance-while-minimizing-risk#:~:text=Official%20support%20for%20Solr%20%26,stability%2C%20without%20forcing%20costly%20migrations). It notes the end-of-life of Solr 8 in 2024 and the need for continued support. This highlights the issue of official support gaps and how businesses with legacy Solr face decisions (upgrade, pay for support, or migrate), relating to retention vs. disaffection considerations.

9. **Stack Overflow Developer Survey & OpenLogic 2024 Reports:** (Referenced indirectly via secondary sources). These provided general context on open-source usage. For example, OpenLogic’s report (snippet in search results) indicated a single-digit percentage of respondents using Solr, which aligns with Solr being a niche compared to ubiquitous databases. We did not cite these directly in the text, but they corroborate the overall decline in Solr’s mindshare among developers.

Each source above was used to ensure that our analysis is grounded in reported facts, surveys, or expert observations rather than conjecture. By combining community commentary (e.g., Hull’s blog), industry metrics (DB-Engines, surveys), and official Apache Solr information, we aimed to present a well-rounded and evidence-backed picture of Solr’s user attraction and attrition in the last 18 months. The consistency across these sources lends credibility to the trends and factors identified in this report.
