# **Apache Solr User Adoption and Retention (2024–2025 Analysis)**

## **Executive Summary**

Apache Solr is a long-standing open-source search platform that continues to attract a dedicated user base, especially for SolrCloud deployments in enterprise settings. Over the last 18 months, Solr has introduced new features (e.g. vector search integration and performance improvements) and maintained an active community, though its growth is modest relative to competitors. Many organizations choose Solr for its robust search capabilities, Apache 2.0 licensing, and proven scalability in production (Confidence: High)[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=Apache%20Solr%20is%20an%20open,and%20customization%20across%20various%20enterprise)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Popularity%20%26%20Adoption%20Popular%20for,time%20applications). At the same time, Solr faces strong competition from Elasticsearch and the AWS-backed OpenSearch, which offer easier cloud deployment and more out-of-the-box tooling. These alternatives have significantly higher popularity – Elasticsearch’s adoption is roughly four times that of Solr by recent industry metrics[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=capabilities,40) – and are drawing interest from new users (Confidence: High). Consequently, while Solr retains many long-time users due to its reliability and features, some potential adopters are deterred by its operational complexity and slower pace of innovation, and a subset of existing users are migrating away to managed services for greater convenience (Confidence: High)[tecracer.com](https://www.tecracer.com/blog/solr-to-opensearch-migration-2024/#:~:text=Why%20Migrate%3F)[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Community%20health%20metrics%20are%20all,contributors%20to%20the%20main%20repo). The analysis below details Solr’s current user attraction and retention factors versus the barriers that deter new users and causes of user disaffection, with comparisons to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch and supporting metrics on community activity. Each major claim is annotated with a **confidence level** (High/Medium/Low) based on the strength of the supporting evidence.

*For context, the relative popularity of search engines has shifted over time. **Elasticsearch (blue)** is currently by far the most widely used, **Solr (green)** has declined from its peak but remains in use, and **OpenSearch (orange)** has been rising steadily since its 2021 introduction. (Source: DB-Engines popularity trend for search engines.)*

## **User Attraction Factors (SolrCloud)**

* **Open Source License & Vendor-Neutral Governance** – Solr is an Apache Software Foundation project under the Apache 2.0 license, which appeals to organizations seeking a truly open, community-driven solution with no licensing fees or vendor lock-in (Confidence: High). This has become a bigger draw after Elastic’s 2021 license change, as Solr offers a permissively licensed alternative [nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=First%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20address%20the%20elephant,Elasticsearch%20as%20a%20Managed%20Service)[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=Apache%20Solr%20has%20a%20longer,more%20popular%20than%20Apache%20Solr). Many companies value that Solr’s roadmap is driven by an open community rather than a single vendor, ensuring transparency and longevity (Confidence: High).

* **Rich Search Features and Relevance Tuning** – Solr’s core strength is advanced full-text search capabilities that attract users with complex search requirements. It provides powerful features out-of-the-box: e.g. faceted navigation, granular text analysis (stemming, synonyms), result highlighting, and a sophisticated query language allowing complex boolean queries and ranking tweaks (Confidence: High)[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=1,Although%20Solr%E2%80%99s%20schemas%20can)[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=1%29%20Advanced%20Full). These features make Solr especially appealing for e-commerce product search, publishing, and other use cases needing fine-tuned relevancy and faceting. Solr’s robust faceted search is often cited as more flexible for structured categorical search than competitors (Confidence: High)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Popularity%20%26%20Adoption%20Popular%20for,time%20applications)[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=1,cannot%20match%20Elasticsearch%20in%20that).

* **Scalability and SolrCloud Architecture** – SolrCloud (Solr’s distributed mode) offers proven scalability and fault-tolerance that draw users with large-scale or mission-critical search applications. Solr’s architecture supports distributed indexing, sharding, and replication across nodes, with external Apache Zookeeper coordinating cluster state for high availability[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=As%20we%20already%20mentioned%20Apache,the%20data%20across%20the%20nodes)[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=3%29%20Fault). This battle-tested architecture has powered search at many of the world’s largest organizations[github.com](https://github.com/apache/solr#:~:text=Solr%20is%20the%20blazing,of%20the%20world%27s%20largest%20organizations), giving new adopters confidence that Solr can handle production workloads at scale (Confidence: High). In particular, industries like media publishing and online retail, which have long used Solr for heavy search traffic, demonstrate its capability to reliably serve enterprise search needs (Confidence: High)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Popularity%20%26%20Adoption%20Popular%20for,time%20applications).
    * IMO this is true for all of the Lucene-based search engines at this point, and doesn't really say anything unique about Solr. Probably not a real "attraction" factor if it's true for all of the market options

* **Maturity and Stability** – With over 15 years of development, Solr is a mature platform, which reassures new users that they are adopting stable technology with well-understood behavior (Confidence: High). Solr’s long history (it became an Apache top-level project in 2021 after years alongside Lucene) means it has extensive documentation, a comprehensive test suite, and broad community knowledge for troubleshooting. Organizations often cite Solr’s track record and backward compatibility across versions as reasons to trust it for critical applications (Confidence: Medium). For example, Solr’s recent 9.x series builds on decades of Lucene improvements while keeping APIs like the “v2” API and SolrJ client stable, thereby attracting users who prioritize reliability over the latest bells and whistles.

* **Emerging Features (AI/Vector Search)** – Far from being stagnant, Solr has been adding modern search features that attract new interest. In the last 18 months, the project introduced **dense vector search** capabilities (leveraging Lucene’s HNSW algorithms) and integration hooks for machine learning embedding services[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Areas%20of%20development%20%26%20interest%3A,there%20are%20always%20more). This allows Solr to support semantic search and AI-driven relevance tuning (e.g. via Learning-to-Rank or external embeddings) – features that are increasingly in demand (Confidence: High)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=analytics%2C%20observability%2C%20real,relevancy%20tuning%2C%20pluggable%20relevancy%20algorithm)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Faceting%20%26%20Aggregations%20Strong%20hierarchical,Indices%20used%20for%20multi). The addition of vector search in Solr 9\.**x** and the planned Solr 10.0 release (expected in 2025\) signal to new users that Solr is keeping up with trends like AI/ML integration (Confidence: High)[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Areas%20of%20development%20%26%20interest%3A,auth%27%20modules)[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Qualitatively%20the%20community%20feels%20active%2C,come%20out%20later%20this%20year). Organizations looking for an open-source search engine that can handle both traditional keyword queries and modern vector similarity queries may be drawn to SolrCloud’s evolving capabilities.
  * This point is accurate for minor version releases, but definitely not for major versions (ultimately due to restriction in Lucene)
  * Again - recent vector/AI improvements are great, but probably not really a factor in terms of attraction since Elastic, OpenSearch etc. are all pushing down this road as well.

* **Community Support and Ecosystem** – Solr’s active community and ecosystem can itself attract users. The project holds monthly public virtual meetups that are well-attended, serving as forums for Q\&A and sharing use cases [whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=,users%40%27%20mailing%20lists%20remains%20active). There is a dedicated Slack channel and user mailing list with steady traffic (Solr’s dev mailing list discussions were up \~78% in one recent quarter) [whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=,the%20community%20discussion%20remains%20strong), indicating an engaged user community (Confidence: High). New adopters often find comfort in knowing they can tap into this community for support and plugins. Additionally, the Solr ecosystem includes complementary tools – e.g. **Solr Operator for Kubernetes** (donated by Bloomberg) to simplify cloud deployments, and client libraries for many languages – which lower the barrier to adoption in cloud-native environments (Confidence: High)[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=,there%20are%20always%20more)[apache.github.io](https://apache.github.io/solr-operator/#:~:text=The%20project%20is%20Production%20Ready%2C,the%20largest%20users%20of%20Solr). The availability of a well-maintained official Docker image (with over 1 million pulls on Docker Hub) and Helm charts also attracts developers who want a quick start in containerized setups[docker.com](https://www.docker.com/blog/creating-ai-enhanced-document-management-with-the-genai-stack/#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20the%20Alfresco,more%20than%201%20million%20pulls)[docker.com](https://www.docker.com/blog/creating-ai-enhanced-document-management-with-the-genai-stack/#:~:text=,for%20user%20interaction%20and%20accessibility).
  * This does seem like a differentiator in terms of "attraction".  Doesn't seem particularly related to "Community/Ecosystem" though...

## **User Retention Factors (Why Users Continue Using Solr)**

* **Proven Reliability and Performance at Scale** – Existing users often stick with SolrCloud because it has demonstrated it can reliably handle their search workloads. In production scenarios requiring high uptime and fast query responses across large indexes, Solr has delivered fault-tolerant performance for years (Confidence: High). Its **leader–replica** architecture (previously master-slave) with automatic failover ensures continuity, and features like distributed caching and efficient index merge scheduling keep query latency low under heavy load [zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=3%29%20Fault). Many organizations have tuned Solr to their needs (schema, analyzers, relevancy parameters) and find it continues to meet performance SLAs, reducing any incentive to switch (Confidence: High). For example, e-commerce sites with millions of products or publishers with vast content libraries retain Solr because it consistently serves queries within required milliseconds, and they trust its stability after years of optimization.

* **Feature Completeness and Customizability** – Long-term Solr users are often deeply invested in Solr’s rich feature set, which encourages them to continue using it. Solr’s support for advanced use cases like **streaming expressions** (for on-the-fly analytics and aggregations), **complex boolean query logic**, **custom scoring plugins**, and **multi-tenant collections** means that many organizations have built sophisticated search solutions that leverage these capabilities. Such features may not be easily replicated in other engines without significant rework, so users retain Solr to avoid losing functionality (Confidence: Medium). Solr’s plugin architecture (e.g. custom analyzers, request handlers, update processors) allows organizations to extend it in-place; companies with bespoke search components tend to remain with Solr rather than rewrite for a different platform (Confidence: Medium). In summary, the breadth of Solr’s capabilities (from faceting to geospatial search to content parsing) provides little incentive for existing users to migrate away when those features continue to fulfill their needs.

* **Inertia and Integration Lock-In** – A practical retention factor is the cost and complexity of migrating away. Many enterprises have integrated Solr deeply into their data pipelines, applications, and operations. They have skilled Solr developers/admins, indexing scripts, and monitoring tailored to SolrCloud. This creates a natural inertia: **“if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.”** Users with terabytes of indexed data and complex Solr schemas are reluctant to risk downtime or relevance changes by moving to another engine (Confidence: High). Additionally, Solr often powers multiple dependent systems (e.g. intranet search, analytics dashboards, e-commerce site search) via its well-known REST APIs; replacing Solr means reworking these integrations. Unless a competitor offers a dramatically compelling benefit, the safer path for many organizations is to stay on Solr and upgrade versions gradually (Confidence: High).

* **Ongoing Improvements and Roadmap Reassurance** – The Solr project’s continued (if measured) development gives existing users confidence that the technology is not “end-of-life,” encouraging them to stay. In the past 18 months, the community has issued several releases (Solr 9.4 up through 9.8.1) with bug fixes, performance boosts (e.g. multi-threaded search), and security patches [whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Areas%20of%20development%20%26%20interest%3A,Search%20and%20other%20performance%20improvements)[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Recent%20releases%3A%20,25). Major enhancements on the horizon – such as **Solr 10.0** (in planning for 2025\) – signal a commitment to keep Solr modern and efficient [whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=However%20the%20community%20still%20feels,planned%20for%20this%20summer)[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=). This active roadmap helps retain users who might otherwise worry about stagnation. For instance, the work on *“Project Zero”* for storing Solr indexes in cloud object stores (S3) and on simplifying Solr’s client APIs shows adaptation to cloud trends [whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Areas%20of%20development%20%26%20interest%3A,and%20also%20Solr%20module). Users see that their pain points (e.g. autoscaling, easier ops) are being addressed via community-driven Solr Improvement Proposals (SIPs), so they choose to remain and benefit from these upcoming improvements (Confidence: High).

* **Community and Support Ecosystem** – The supportive Solr community also plays a role in retaining users. Active mailing lists, community meetups, and forums (now even exploring a move to Discourse for easier Q\&A) ensure that users can get help and share solutions [whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=,Discourse%20or%20GitHub%20Discussions%3B%20TBD). Over the last year, Solr’s dev/user mailing list traffic has generally been strong (with some quarters seeing 10–15% increases in discussion) [whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=), indicating an engaged user base that helps each other (Confidence: High). Long-time users often cite the responsiveness of the community and the availability of experienced consultants/experts as a reason to stick with Solr rather than move to a platform where they have less community familiarity. Furthermore, third-party support from companies like Lucidworks, OpenLogic, and others provides professional services and tooling (e.g. monitoring via Sematext, GUI front-ends) that make continuing with Solr viable for enterprises (Confidence: Medium). In short, Solr users feel “looked after” by a combination of volunteer community and commercial support options, aiding retention.

## **User Deterrence Factors (Barriers to Adoption)**

* **Operational Complexity (Zookeeper Dependency)** – One of the biggest deterrents for new users evaluating SolrCloud is its operational overhead. SolrCloud requires running an external Apache Zookeeper ensemble to coordinate the cluster (for leader election, config storage, etc.), which adds complexity to deployment and maintenance (Confidence: High). This stands in contrast to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, which manage cluster state internally and can form clusters more easily out-of-the-box [bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=designed%20with%20modern%20cloud%20deployments,and%20replicas%20for%20distributed%20processing)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Both%20Solr%20and%20OpenSearch%20are,operate%20efficiently%20and%20without%20disruptions). New users without existing infrastructure expertise may find SolrCloud’s setup daunting, as they must configure and monitor Zookeeper in addition to Solr nodes (Confidence: High). As a result, organizations with limited DevOps resources or those preferring turnkey solutions are often deterred from choosing Solr, opting for alternatives that promise simpler cluster management. The Solr community is aware of this hurdle – efforts exist (e.g. **Solr Operator** on Kubernetes, and reducing ZK reliance in clients[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=%2A%20Multi,reliance%20in%20SolrJ%27s%20%22CloudSolrClient)) – but the perception remains that SolrCloud is harder to operate at scale (especially in dynamic cloud environments) compared to its competitors.

* **Lack of Managed Cloud Services** – In the era of cloud-first deployments, the absence of widely available managed Solr services is a notable adoption barrier. Unlike Elasticsearch (offered by Elastic Cloud, and analogous services by many vendors) or OpenSearch (offered as a fully managed AWS service), Apache Solr does not have an official, large-scale cloud provider service. This means potential users must self-host and manage SolrCloud clusters, incurring maintenance effort that deters those who prefer a hands-off approach (Confidence: High). As evidence of this trend, Amazon’s OpenSearch Service has attracted interest specifically by marketing a hassle-free alternative to self-managed Solr [tecracer.com](https://www.tecracer.com/blog/solr-to-opensearch-migration-2024/#:~:text=Though%20Apache%20Solr%20has%20been,platforms%20like%20Amazon%20OpenSearch%20Service)[tecracer.com](https://www.tecracer.com/blog/solr-to-opensearch-migration-2024/#:~:text=Why%20Migrate%3F). Many organizations find the allure of “click-button” managed clusters (with automated scaling, patching, backups, etc.) strong enough that they shy away from Solr despite its features. Unless a user has a mandate for on-prem or open-source purity, the convenience of managed offerings for Elastic/OpenSearch often outweighs the case for adopting SolrCloud, posing a significant deterrent to new users.

* **Perception of Smaller Ecosystem & Community Momentum** – New adopters may be wary of Solr’s ecosystem vitality relative to its rivals. Elasticsearch has a highly visible community and ecosystem (hundreds of Stack Overflow questions, meetup groups, plugins, etc.), and OpenSearch enjoys backing by AWS and others with active development. In contrast, Solr’s community, while mature, is perceived as smaller and “quieter” in recent years. For instance, Apache board reports in early 2024 noted that mailing list activity was **down compared to the previous year** and overall community metrics had dipped (issues opened down 36%, contributors down \~8%) [whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Community%20health%20metrics%20are%20all,contributors%20to%20the%20main%20repo). Although activity picked up later in 2024, this initial impression can deter risk-averse decision-makers (Confidence: Medium). The lack of a big corporate sponsor solely devoted to Solr (compared to Elastic NV for Elasticsearch or AWS for OpenSearch) may also give newcomers pause about the long-term vibrancy of the ecosystem (Confidence: Medium). In practical terms, a prospective user might find fewer recent online tutorials, fewer “out-of-the-box” GUI tools (no equivalent to Kibana by default), and a smaller talent pool claiming Solr experience – all of which can discourage adoption in favor of the more popular alternatives.

* **Feature Gaps and Modern Use-Case Alignment** – While Solr is very capable in traditional search, some newcomers might perceive that it lags in certain modern features, creating a barrier. For example, **native analytics and visualization**: Elasticsearch gained popularity partly due to the ELK stack (Elasticsearch+Logstash+Kibana) for log analytics; Solr lacks an official integrated analytics UI, requiring external tools for similar functionality[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=OpenSearch%20Ingest%20Pipelines%20and%20others,time%20visualization)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Visualization%20No%20built,time%20visualization). Similarly, OpenSearch includes built-in observability plugins and dashboards, plus features like anomaly detection and vector search plugins out-of-the-box, whereas leveraging similar capabilities in Solr might involve more manual integration or third-party tools[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=degree%20of%20freedom,in)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=management,time%20visualization). New users with use cases in log monitoring, APM, or security analytics might therefore skip Solr, seeing Elastic/OpenSearch as more ready-made. Another gap is **schema flexibility**: Elasticsearch’s schema-less JSON document model is appealing for quick starts, whereas Solr’s default requires defining schemas (which can be dynamic but not as seamlessly as ES mappings)[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=2,highly%20scalable%2C%20Elasticsearch%20has%20a). For prototyping or agile teams, this can be a deterrent (Confidence: Medium). In summary, if a potential adopter’s needs align with areas where Solr requires more DIY assembly (visualizations, cloud integrations, ML features), they may be discouraged by the extra effort compared to competitor ecosystems.

* **Competitive Popularity and Mindshare** – Simply put, many potential users are swayed by the popularity contest: Elasticsearch remains the de-facto choice for search in many developers’ minds, with OpenSearch rapidly gaining mindshare post-2021. According to the DB-Engines index (April 2025), Elasticsearch is the \#1 search engine with a popularity score \~128, while Solr is a distant \#3 at \~32[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=capabilities,40). In a 2024 open-source survey, \~37% of organizations reported using Elasticsearch, \~9.6% using OpenSearch, but only \~6.8% using Solr[openlogic.com](https://www.openlogic.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/report-ol-state-of-oss-2024.pdf#:~:text=ElasticSearch%2040.20,Apache%20Kafka%2016.33)[openlogic.com](https://www.openlogic.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/report-ol-state-of-oss-2024.pdf#:~:text=OpenSearch%209.58,Apache%20Flink%206.39). These statistics (Confidence: High) highlight a network effect: new users often choose the technology that appears most commonly adopted in industry. The richer pool of online knowledge, integrations (e.g. many SaaS products export data to Elastic-compatible endpoints), and resumes mentioning Elasticsearch can outright deter evaluation of Solr. It can become a self-fulfilling cycle where fewer new projects start with Solr, because managers see fewer success stories in the wild compared to its competitors. This *“herd mentality”* is a non-technical but potent deterrence factor in the current landscape.

## **User Disaffection Factors (Why Some Users Leave or Reduce Solr Usage)**

* **Desire for Managed Services & Reduced Ops Burden** – A prominent reason existing users have been abandoning Solr (or plan to) is to offload operations. Running large SolrCloud clusters—handling server maintenance, scaling, Zookeeper quirks, version upgrades—can become burdensome and costly. Such users may become disaffected when they see alternative solutions offering to take over that burden. For example, AWS actively encourages Solr users to migrate to Amazon OpenSearch Service, promising **simplified management and easy scalability** on the cloud[tecracer.com](https://www.tecracer.com/blog/solr-to-opensearch-migration-2024/#:~:text=Migrating%20from%20Solr%20to%20OpenSearch,to%20Amazon%20OpenSearch%20Service%20include)[tecracer.com](https://www.tecracer.com/blog/solr-to-opensearch-migration-2024/#:~:text=,transit%2C%20among%20other%20security%20features). Over the last 18 months, some organizations using Solr have indeed evaluated or executed migrations, especially if they are already AWS-centric (Confidence: High). The availability of managed OpenSearch (and to an extent, Elastic’s own cloud) gives an attractive escape hatch: instead of self-managing Solr, they switch to a hosted platform even if it means adjusting their application. This trend is reflected in blogs and guides (e.g. *“Why and How to Migrate from Solr to OpenSearch”*[tecracer.com](https://www.tecracer.com/blog/solr-to-opensearch-migration-2024/#:~:text=Though%20Apache%20Solr%20has%20been,platforms%20like%20Amazon%20OpenSearch%20Service)), indicating that reducing ops toil is a key driver of Solr disaffection. We have high confidence in this factor, as it’s backed by multiple sources and real-world migrations.

* **Advanced Features and Innovation Elsewhere** – Some long-time Solr users grow disaffected if they perceive they’re missing out on cutting-edge features available in other engines. While Solr has added vectors and remains strong in core search, competitors have surged ahead in areas like machine learning integration, automated anomaly detection, and real-time analytics. Elasticsearch, for instance, introduced features for time-series data, transformed search (EQL, SIEM features), and a stack of APM/logging tools; OpenSearch has a **ML Commons** plugin (for anomaly detection, k-NN, etc.) and features like segment replication for efficiency[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=Since%20the%20two%20search%20engines,indexed%20on%20each%20shard%20copy)[bigdataboutique.com](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/apache-solr-vs-opensearch-comparison-and-key-differences-d7c790#:~:text=Faceting%20%26%20Aggregations%20Strong%20hierarchical,Indices%20used%20for%20multi). If an organization’s needs evolve towards these capabilities, they might feel Solr is not advancing fast enough. Over the past year, some Solr users exploring AI-driven search or unified analytics found themselves building custom solutions or using external libraries, whereas Elastic/OpenSearch users could leverage built-in solutions – a frustration that can prompt switching (Confidence: Medium). Essentially, if Solr’s roadmap doesn’t match a user’s innovation pace, they may become dissatisfied and migrate to a platform perceived as more feature-rich or future-proof.
  * Solr has segment replication with TLOG/PULL replication model.

* **Performance or Scaling Limitations in Specific Cases** – Although SolrCloud scales well, there are scenarios where users have hit limitations or complexity that led them to re-evaluate. For example, certain real-time indexing workloads and very large cluster scenarios might be easier to manage in Elasticsearch due to its shard rebalancing design. A few organizations report difficulties with Solr’s near-real-time indexing under constant heavy writes (perhaps due to more manual tuning needed for merges and soft commits) and found Elastic’s approach more straightforward (Confidence: Low). Similarly, cross-datacenter or geo-distributed search is an area where Solr historically lacked an official solution (work on cross-DC replication is ongoing[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Areas%20of%20development%20%26%20interest%3A,there%20are%20always%20more)), so users needing active-active multi-region search sometimes felt compelled to move to other technologies. While these cases are not the norm, they contribute to disaffection when Solr’s capabilities fall slightly short of a particular use case’s demands. Our confidence here is low to medium, as evidence is mostly anecdotal (e.g. isolated migration stories on tech blogs) rather than broad surveys.
  * Geo is very much there: https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/query-guide/spatial-search.html

* **Changing Corporate Direction and Support** – In some instances, a company’s strategic decisions cause a shift away from Solr. For example, if a major sponsor or contributor to Solr shifts focus, the community energy can dip and influence others. An Apache Solr report noted that no Solr-dedicated conference had been held in recent years partly because a long-time sponsor scaled back involvement[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=We%20are%20conducting%20monthly%20community,video%29%3B%20going%20well). This kind of change can sow doubt among enterprise users about the ecosystem’s vibrancy. Additionally, if a new CTO or architect at a company favors a different stack (perhaps due to personal experience or industry trends), they might mandate migrating off Solr despite it working – essentially “jumping on the bandwagon” of Elastic or cloud services. Existing Solr users can become disaffected not because of Solr’s faults per se, but due to external influences like hiring availability (far more engineers list Elasticsearch on their CV, which can make it easier to hire for Elastic skills than Solr skills). These socio-business factors have medium impact and confidence: they are real but case-dependent. Over 2024–2025 we’ve seen some large firms that historically used Solr begin new projects on other platforms, indicating a gradual drift that is less about Solr failing and more about ecosystem gravity.
  * Although this is probably true, it likely applies to any technology and/or search engine.

* **Security and Maintenance Concerns** – A minor but notable cause of disaffection is the effort required to keep Solr secure and up-to-date. Solr suffered from the widespread **Log4j vulnerability (Log4Shell)** in late 2021, and while patches came, administrators had to scramble to upgrade or mitigate. Solr also requires regular attention to security (e.g. configuring authentication, which is not enabled by default in older versions). Some users, especially those without dedicated teams, might feel safer with a platform that has security features on by default or a vendor to handle urgent patches. If an organization had a negative experience (like a security incident or painful upgrade), they might reduce Solr usage afterwards. Over the last 18 months, the Solr team has been actively addressing CVEs and articulating a security model[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Security%3A%20We%20are%20finally%20addressing,that%20might%20invalidate%20proposed%20vulnerabilities), but the onus is on users to apply updates. In comparison, a managed service or a more locked-down solution could appear more attractive. We have low confidence in this being a primary factor (few publicly documented cases), but it can contribute to the decision when combined with other issues.
  * The point here seems to be that managed service requires less work (true), and not necessarily security concern of itself.

## **Confidence Assessment**

Each of the claims above has been tagged with a confidence level, reflecting how well-supported the claim is by current data and sources:

* **High Confidence** – Facts or trends backed by strong evidence such as multiple independent sources, official metrics, or broad industry consensus. For example, claims about Solr’s open-source appeal[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=First%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20address%20the%20elephant,Elasticsearch%20as%20a%20Managed%20Service), its feature strengths[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=1%29%20Advanced%20Full), and competitive popularity stats[zymr.com](https://www.zymr.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-introductory-comparison#:~:text=capabilities,40) are rated High confidence. We have high confidence in Solr’s core attraction (open license, robust search features) and well-documented deterrents (operational complexity, lack of managed services), as these are consistently reported in credible sources.

* **Medium Confidence** – Points that have some evidence but may be based on narrower samples or logical inference. Many retention and disaffection factors fall here. For instance, the idea that users stay due to integration lock-in or custom features is plausible and commonly mentioned, but not easily quantified (Medium). Likewise, the perception of Solr’s slower ecosystem momentum is noted qualitatively in community reports[whimsy.apache.org](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Solr.html#:~:text=Community%20health%20metrics%20are%20all,contributors%20to%20the%20main%20repo) and comparisons, but exact impact on adoption is hard to measure, hence Medium confidence.

* **Low Confidence** – Speculative or less substantiated claims, often from anecdotal reports. We marked a few niche performance/scale-related disaffection reasons as Low confidence, since broad data is lacking and these may not generalize. We err on the side of caution with such claims; they are possible factors but not strongly supported by the data we gathered in this research.

Overall, our highest confidence lies in broad trends (e.g. Solr’s popularity relative to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, and the influence of managed services on user decisions), which are backed by quantitative data. More nuanced user sentiment factors (like frustration with missing features or internal corporate decisions) are acknowledged with medium or low confidence. This confidence-rated approach underscores which findings are solid versus which are educated conjectures, providing transparency in the strength of each assertion.

5. **Nine.ch – “Comparing Solr, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch” (Kevin Ferranti, May 28, 2024\)** – Gave a neutral comparison of the three engines and noted Elasticsearch’s licensing change and popularity edge. Confirmed that as of 2024 Elastic remained more popular than Solr, and highlighted differences like schema flexibility and community size[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=Apache%20Solr%20has%20a%20longer,more%20popular%20than%20Apache%20Solr)[nine.ch](https://nine.ch/search-engines-comparing-solr-elasticsearch-and-opensearch/#:~:text=2,highly%20scalable%2C%20Elasticsearch%20has%20a). Supported points on license-driven adoption considerations and feature differences.

6. **OpenLogic 2024 State of Open Source Report** – Industry survey report (Perforce/OpenLogic) providing usage statistics. We cited the section where respondents indicated technology usage: \~37% using Elasticsearch, \~9.6% OpenSearch, \~6.8% Apache Solr[openlogic.com](https://www.openlogic.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/report-ol-state-of-oss-2024.pdf#:~:text=ElasticSearch%2040.20,Apache%20Kafka%2016.33)[openlogic.com](https://www.openlogic.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/report-ol-state-of-oss-2024.pdf#:~:text=OpenSearch%209.58,Apache%20Flink%206.39). This statistical evidence underpins claims about Solr’s smaller user base relative to competitors.

7. **Docker Blog – GenAI Stack (Angel Borroy & Ajeet Raina, 2024\)** – Included context on Docker image pulls: noted that Alfresco’s use of Solr has core services each with \>1 million pulls on Docker Hub[docker.com](https://www.docker.com/blog/creating-ai-enhanced-document-management-with-the-genai-stack/#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20the%20Alfresco,more%20than%201%20million%20pulls). While not directly about Solr’s popularity, it illustrates Solr’s integration into major platforms (Alfresco) and implies significant usage of Solr’s official container, supporting the point that Solr remains widely deployed in certain sectors[docker.com](https://www.docker.com/blog/creating-ai-enhanced-document-management-with-the-genai-stack/#:~:text=,for%20user%20interaction%20and%20accessibility).
