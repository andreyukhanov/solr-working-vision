# **Report on the State of Apache Solr: User Attraction, Retention, and Churn Analysis (2023-2025)**

## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Apache Solr's position within the enterprise search market over the last 18 months, focusing on the factors that attract, retain, deter, and cause the disaffection of its user base. The analysis reveals a platform at a critical juncture, balancing its legacy of power and stability against the pressures of a rapidly modernizing and highly competitive landscape.

Solr's primary attraction stems from its deep, proven capabilities in core text search, offering unparalleled customizability that continues to draw organizations with complex, domain-specific requirements. This foundational strength has been augmented by a strategic push into modern AI-driven search, with the Solr 9.x release series introducing and consistently enhancing vector search capabilities. This effort, combined with Solr's unwavering commitment to a truly open-source model under the Apache Software Foundation, presents a compelling value proposition for users wary of the restrictive licensing and vendor-driven roadmaps of competitors.

Retention of the existing user base is strong, anchored by the platform's battle-tested reliability and the significant inertia created by the high cost and complexity of migration. For many organizations with deeply embedded Solr deployments, the platform "just works," making the business case for a disruptive and expensive migration difficult to justify. This inertia is now supported by an emerging ecosystem of third-party vendors offering commercial long-term support for end-of-life versions, providing a crucial lifeline for enterprises unable or unwilling to upgrade.

However, Solr faces formidable headwinds that deter new adoption. The platform's operational complexity, primarily its dependency on Apache ZooKeeper for cluster management, presents a steep initial learning curve and is perceived as architecturally dated compared to more streamlined, API-driven competitors like OpenSearch. This is compounded by a gap in out-of-the-box tooling, most notably the lack of an integrated data visualization and dashboarding solution akin to Kibana or OpenSearch Dashboards.

Finally, several factors are actively driving user disaffection and churn. The relentless pace of security vulnerabilities creates significant operational fatigue, while the official end-of-life of the popular Solr 8.x branch has forced many users into a difficult decision: undertake a major upgrade, pay for support, or migrate. This decision is often tilted toward migration by critical ecosystem shifts, such as Spring Boot dropping native support for Solr, and the powerful allure of fully managed, cloud-native search services that promise to eliminate operational overhead.

In conclusion, Apache Solr in 2025 is a powerful, specialized tool, not a default choice. It remains a superior option for organizations that require deep control and customization over their search logic. However, its future viability hinges on its ability to continue modernizing its core capabilities while systematically lowering the barriers to entry and operational friction that currently deter new users and push existing ones toward more convenient alternatives.

## **Analysis of Apache Solr's Market Dynamics**

### **User Attraction Factors: The Enduring Appeal of a Search Veteran**

Apache Solr's ability to attract new users in the current market is rooted in a combination of its foundational strengths, strategic modernization efforts, and a philosophical alignment with the principles of open-source software. These factors appeal to organizations with sophisticated needs that value control, flexibility, and long-term stability over the turnkey simplicity offered by some competitors.

#### **Unmatched Core Search Power and Customizability**

The primary and most enduring attraction of Apache Solr is its comprehensive and highly customizable core search functionality. For decades, it has been a leader in enterprise search, and its feature set reflects this maturity. It offers robust capabilities in full-text search, hit highlighting, advanced faceting and filtering, rich document handling (including formats like Word and PDF), and database integration. This deep feature set is a significant draw for organizations whose primary challenge is sophisticated, text-centric information retrieval rather than just log analytics or simple keyword matching.

User reviews from 2024 and 2025 consistently validate this strength. Users describe Solr as a "great tool for storing and indexing large number of records" and praise its ability to handle massive datasets with speed and accuracy. The platform's powerful query language and APIs allow developers to construct complex search logic, including custom filtering, sorting, and relevance tuning, to meet precise business requirements. One reviewer highlighted its "powerful search capabilities including filtering, sorting, results relevancy, number of search matches, stop words to reduce noise in results, synonyms to search other words and much more".

This level of customizability is a key differentiator. While competitors may offer simpler initial setup, Solr provides granular control over the entire indexing and query pipeline. Teams that need to implement highly specific relevance models, custom text analyzers, or intricate faceting logic find that Solr provides the necessary tools and access points, attracting users who have outgrown the capabilities of simpler search solutions.

#### **Strategic Modernization: Embracing AI and Vector Search**

Recognizing the seismic shift towards AI-driven search, the Apache Solr project has made a deliberate and significant effort to modernize the platform, making it attractive to a new generation of developers with AI-centric requirements. The Solr 9.x release series has been the vehicle for this transformation, with the flagship feature being the introduction of "neural" search capabilities. This began in Solr 9.0 with the release of the

`DenseVectorField` field type and the K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) Query Parser, which together enable semantic search based on vector embeddings.

This was not a one-time feature drop but the beginning of a sustained development effort over the last 18 months. Subsequent releases have consistently enhanced these capabilities. Solr 9.7 introduced a new `vectorSimilarity` QParser for threshold-based matching and significant performance improvements for vector search when running on Java 21\. More recently, Solr 9.8 and 9.9 have added the crucial ability to encode text into vectors

*during* the indexing process by making calls to external Large Language Model (LLM) services. This directly addresses the core need of modern search applications, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by integrating the vectorization process into the Solr workflow.

The introduction of these features is a direct and necessary competitive response to market trends largely set by Elasticsearch and OpenSearch. The rise of vector search as a mainstream requirement meant that without these capabilities, Solr risked being relegated to a legacy tool for "traditional keyword and faceted search use cases" only. By adding and refining its neural search features, Solr is actively fighting this perception and signaling to the market that it is not stagnant. It is now a viable, if distinct, player in the vector search space, attracting users who require modern AI capabilities but prefer to build on Solr's stable foundation. The community itself acknowledges that it must do a better job of advertising these features to combat outdated perceptions of the platform's capabilities.

#### **The Value Proposition of True Open Source and ASF Governance**

In a market increasingly defined by complex and restrictive software licenses, Apache Solr's governance and licensing model has become a powerful attraction factor. Solr is a Top-Level Project of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and is distributed under the permissive, OSI-approved Apache License 2.0. This provides users with the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software with very few restrictions, a guarantee of long-term stability and predictability that is increasingly rare.

This value proposition was thrown into sharp relief by the actions of its primary competitor, Elastic. In 2021, Elastic moved Elasticsearch from the Apache 2.0 license to a dual-license model including the restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL), a move designed to prevent cloud providers from offering Elasticsearch as a managed service without a commercial agreement. This licensing change, and the subsequent fork of the last open-source version of Elasticsearch into the Apache 2.0-licensed OpenSearch, created a clear market schism.

In this new landscape, Solr's long-standing commitment to the ASF's "Community Over Code" philosophy became a major strategic advantage. It attracts a specific and growing user segment: organizations with strict open-source compliance mandates, those building commercial products on top of search technology, and those with a strategic aversion to vendor lock-in and unpredictable licensing changes. Solr did not need to change its strategy to gain this advantage; its main competitor created it for them, making Solr's stable, community-governed model a significant draw for risk-averse users.

#### **Deployment Flexibility: Control Over Infrastructure**

Apache Solr attracts users with diverse infrastructural and operational requirements by offering a wide range of deployment options. It can be run as a simple standalone server for smaller projects, in a highly available and scalable SolrCloud cluster for enterprise workloads, or containerized for modern DevOps environments.

The project has actively supported modern deployment paradigms. The official Docker images are well-maintained, frequently updated, and available in both full and slim variants, providing a straightforward path to containerization. A pivotal development was the donation of the Solr Operator from Bloomberg to the ASF in late 2020, which has since become the official, community-managed tool for deploying and running Solr on Kubernetes. The Operator has seen frequent updates over the past 18 months, with versions 0.7.0 through 0.9.1 adding features for enhanced security configuration, resource management, and multi-availability zone deployments.

This deployment flexibility allows organizations to maintain complete control over their data and infrastructure. This is a critical requirement for those with on-premise mandates, specific security and compliance constraints, or a desire to avoid the managed cloud services that competitors increasingly push users towards. For teams that value infrastructural sovereignty, Solr provides the tools to build, deploy, and manage their search platform on their own terms.

### **User Retention Factors: Why Loyalists Remain with Solr**

While attracting new users is a challenge, Apache Solr demonstrates a powerful ability to retain its existing user base. This loyalty is not passive; it is an active choice driven by the platform's proven reliability, the powerful inertia of high switching costs, evidence of continued development, and the emergence of a commercial support ecosystem that mitigates the risks of its open-source nature.

#### **Decades of Proven Stability and Reliability**

A core reason users stay with Solr is its reputation as a mature, stable, and battle-tested platform. It has a long history of powering search for "some of the most heavily-trafficked websites and applications in the world," which builds immense institutional trust. For organizations running mission-critical applications, this history of reliability is a compelling reason to stay with a known quantity.

User reviews from the last 18 months consistently reinforce this perception. It is described as "highly reliable and scalable" and a "simply superb tool for querying and search". This stability is a powerful retention factor, particularly in enterprise environments where predictability and uptime are valued more highly than access to the latest bleeding-edge features. The project's development cadence, often described as "cautious" and "stable" , contributes to this feeling of reliability. Unlike platforms with more aggressive release cycles, Solr reserves major breaking changes for major version releases (e.g., from 8.x to 9.0), allowing users to operate on a given version with a high degree of confidence in its stability.

#### **The High Cost and Risk of Migration (Inertia)**

Arguably the single most powerful retention factor for Apache Solr is the immense cost, complexity, and risk associated with migrating away from it. For any organization with a non-trivial, deeply integrated Solr deployment, switching to a platform like Elasticsearch or OpenSearch is a massive engineering project, not a simple component swap.

The technical hurdles are substantial. A migration requires a complete re-indexing of all data, which can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process for large collections. More significantly, all application-level query logic and integrations must be completely rewritten. This involves translating Solr's URL parameter-based query syntax and

`schema.xml` configurations into the JSON-based Query DSL and API-driven index mappings used by Elasticsearch and OpenSearch. Furthermore, any custom functionality built using Solr's unique features—such as its advanced faceting, query-time boosting, or custom text analyzers—requires a painstaking feature-by-feature audit and reimplementation on the new platform.

Analysts estimate that such a migration can easily consume "weeks or months of work, testing, and potential downtime". This immense switching cost creates a powerful form of inertia. A technology leader weighing the certainty of a multi-month, high-cost migration project against the reality of a currently functioning and reliable Solr system will very often choose to retain Solr. This dynamic is a critical retention mechanism; the platform's perceived complexity in some areas becomes a defensive moat that keeps existing users invested.

#### **Consistent Development and Active Governance**

Despite external perceptions of a slowing pace, the Apache Solr project remains under active development, providing existing users with confidence that their platform of choice is not abandonware. The project became a Top-Level Project (TLP) at the ASF in 2021, giving it more autonomy and a clearer identity separate from its underlying library, Apache Lucene.

The evidence of this activity is clear in the release history. The last 18 months have seen a steady stream of releases in the 9.x series, from version 9.3.0 up to 9.9.0. Each of these releases has delivered a combination of valuable new features (like LLM integration and improved query capabilities), significant performance improvements (especially for vector search and high-core-count machines), and critical bug fixes. This visible progress, governed by the transparent and consensus-driven processes of "The Apache Way" , assures the existing user base that the project is alive and well, and that their investment continues to be supported by a dedicated, if small, community of developers. Community engagement events, such as the "Birds of a Feather" session at the Community Over Code conference, provide a forum for users and developers to discuss the project's roadmap and future direction, further reinforcing this sense of an active, living project.

#### **The Emerging Commercial Long-Term Support (LTS) Ecosystem**

A new and significant retention factor has emerged in response to the realities of the enterprise software lifecycle. The official end-of-life (EOL) for the entire Solr 8.x version series occurred in October 2024\. This created a major business risk for the large number of organizations still running on this popular branch, as they would no longer receive security patches or support from the ASF.

This situation created a gap between the ASF's community-driven support model, which focuses on current versions, and the needs of large enterprises that often cannot upgrade immediately due to cost, risk, or compatibility constraints. This market vacuum has been filled by third-party commercial vendors like HeroDevs, who now offer "Never-Ending Support" (NES) for EOL versions of Solr. These services provide enterprise-grade security patches, compliance documentation, and specialized expertise for older Solr versions, effectively decoupling a user's operational stability from the official ASF support schedule.

This is a critical retention mechanism. It provides a viable, if paid, alternative for enterprises in regulated industries like finance or e-commerce that cannot accept the risk of running unsupported software but are not ready for a major migration. The existence of this commercial support ecosystem is a sign of Solr's maturity and allows it to retain a significant segment of its user base that would otherwise be forced to churn due to end-of-life pressures. Managed service providers like SearchStax and Opensolr also contribute to retention by abstracting away operational complexities, keeping users on the platform who might otherwise migrate due to management overhead.

### **User Deterrence Factors: Barriers to New Adoption**

While Solr retains its loyalists, it faces significant and growing challenges in attracting new users. These deterrents are a combination of real technical hurdles, negative market perceptions, and the strong competitive posture of more modern alternatives. These factors often prevent Solr from being shortlisted for new projects, particularly those led by teams without prior experience with the platform.

#### **Perceived and Real Operational Complexity**

The most frequently cited deterrent for new users is the operational complexity associated with deploying and managing a production-grade SolrCloud cluster. This complexity is almost entirely attributed to Solr's architectural dependency on Apache ZooKeeper. For a SolrCloud deployment, ZooKeeper is a mandatory external component responsible for critical functions like managing cluster state, distributing configuration files, and handling leader election.

This dependency immediately frames Solr as a technology from a previous architectural era, one more aligned with the Hadoop ecosystem than with modern, cloud-native principles. For a new development team in 2025, this means the initial learning curve involves mastering not one, but two complex distributed systems. User reviews explicitly call out that "configuration is complex compared to other search engines" and that the need to run ZooKeeper is a significant burden. This creates a powerful negative first impression, suggesting a legacy architecture and higher operational overhead before a potential user even begins to evaluate Solr's powerful search features.

This stands in stark contrast to competitors like OpenSearch and Elasticsearch, which have internalized cluster management and are explicitly marketed on the elimination of such external dependencies in favor of simpler, API-driven control planes. While the Solr project has made efforts to reduce the client-side friction—for instance, by improving the ability of the SolrJ client to connect directly to Solr nodes instead of ZooKeeper —this does not remove the underlying server-side dependency. For new adopters, the ZooKeeper requirement remains Solr's primary branding problem and a major barrier to entry.

#### **The Competitive Shadow: Tooling and Mindshare**

Apache Solr no longer operates in a vacuum. It is constantly evaluated against Elasticsearch and its fork, OpenSearch, both of which cast a long shadow in terms of developer mindshare and integrated tooling. The most critical gap in Solr's offering is the lack of a native, integrated data exploration and visualization tool equivalent to Kibana or OpenSearch Dashboards. While Solr provides an excellent Admin UI for cluster management, query debugging, and monitoring , it is not designed for business users or analysts to build dashboards and visually explore the data within the index.

This is more than a missing feature; it is a critical gap in the user acquisition funnel. Tools like Kibana provide an immediate, visual "time-to-value" that is a powerful adoption engine. A new user can ingest data and create a compelling dashboard in minutes, demonstrating the platform's value instantly. Solr's power, in contrast, remains largely hidden behind APIs and configuration files, presenting a much higher initial barrier to engagement. This deters users looking for a complete, integrated solution that serves not only search but also analytics and observability use cases.

This tooling gap contributes to a broader mindshare problem. The developer talent pool is widely perceived to be larger and more accessible for Elasticsearch, making it "easier to hire engineers with Elasticsearch experience, and harder to hire people familiar with Solr". For a manager staffing a new project, this is a significant strategic deterrent. The perception that competitors have a "faster release cadence and richer cloud tooling" creates a narrative of momentum and modernity that Solr, despite its steady development, struggles to counter.

#### **Concerns over Innovation Velocity and Community Size**

A recurring theme among potential and existing users is a concern about the pace of innovation and the size of the community driving the Apache Solr project. While the project is actively maintained, the community is admittedly small. This was stated with stark honesty in a 2024 blog post attributed to the project's maintainers: "We are a small group of passionate developers... We're trying our best, but Solr is lagging behind other open source search engines". Such a public admission, while transparent, can be a major red flag for an organization considering a multi-year investment in the technology.

This perception is echoed in user reviews, with some noting that "There doesn't seem to be a lot of innovation being added to the project". The release cadence, while consistent, is often characterized as "cautious. Stable. Slow," especially when compared to the venture-backed, marketing-driven roadmaps of its competitors. This narrative can deter users who prioritize access to cutting-edge features and want the assurance of a large, well-funded development community behind their chosen platform.

The community itself appears to be aware that this is, in part, a marketing problem. At a recent community event, a key point of discussion was the fact that "not many people know that Apache Lucene and Solr are capable of vector-based and hybrid search". This indicates a gap between the reality of the platform's new capabilities and the market's perception of them, a gap that serves as a significant deterrent to new adoption.

### **User Disaffection Factors: Catalysts for Migration**

Beyond the barriers that deter new users, several specific factors and ongoing pain points actively cause existing, often long-time, users to become dissatisfied and begin the process of migrating away from Apache Solr. These are the catalysts that can overcome the powerful inertia of high switching costs.

#### **Critical Ecosystem Shifts and Deprecations**

Sometimes the impetus to migrate comes not from within Solr, but from shifts in the broader technology ecosystem. A prime example of this is Spring Boot, a dominant framework in the Java world, dropping its out-of-the-box support for Solr while maintaining active support for Elasticsearch. For the vast number of enterprises that build their applications on the Spring framework, this is a major blow. It relegates Solr to a second-class citizen within that ecosystem, increasing the friction and custom code required for integration. This sends a powerful signal that Solr is no longer considered a mainstream choice, creating a strong incentive for development teams to migrate to a platform with first-class framework support. This ecosystem marginalization can create a feedback loop: as major frameworks drop support, fewer developers learn the technology, making it harder to hire experienced engineers, which in turn encourages more organizations to migrate, further reinforcing its marginalization.

Disaffection can also be triggered by internal project decisions. The major release of Solr 9.0 involved the deprecation and removal of several long-standing features that had been bundled with the core product. The Data Import Handler (DIH) and the VelocityResponseWriter, for example, were spun out into independent projects. While this move may have cleaned up the core codebase, for users who relied heavily on these features as integrated components, it introduced a new and unwelcome maintenance and integration burden, potentially souring their experience with the platform.

#### **Security Fatigue and End-of-Life Pressure**

The operational burden of maintaining a secure Solr deployment is a significant source of user disaffection. The last 18 months have seen a relentless pace of security vulnerability disclosures (CVEs), many of them rated as high or critical severity. These have included critical authentication bypasses (CVE-2024-45216), vulnerabilities allowing for remote code execution (RCE) via malicious configsets (CVE-2025-24814), and various information disclosure flaws.

This constant stream of CVEs creates "security fatigue" for operations teams. Each new vulnerability requires an urgent cycle of risk assessment, planning, and often a disruptive, unplanned upgrade or patching effort. This is a significant and ongoing drain on engineering resources. This security burden is not just a technical problem; it elevates to a business risk management issue.

This risk was crystallized for a large portion of the user base with the official end-of-life (EOL) of the entire Solr 8.x version series in October 2024\. This single event is a powerful catalyst for churn. Organizations still running on the popular 8.x branch are now officially unsupported by the ASF and will not receive patches for any new security vulnerabilities. This forces them into a difficult and costly decision:

1. Undertake a complex and resource-intensive upgrade to Solr 9.x.  
2. Pay for commercial long-term support from a third-party vendor.  
3. Accept the significant risk of running unsupported, vulnerable software.  
4. Use this forced decision point as the catalyst to migrate to a different platform altogether.

For many, the combination of security fatigue and EOL pressure makes migration to a managed service, where the cloud provider assumes much of the security and patching burden, an extremely attractive alternative.

#### **The Allure of Managed, Cloud-Native Services**

The maturation of fully managed search services, particularly Amazon OpenSearch Service, presents a compelling exit ramp for disaffected Solr users. These platforms offer a powerful value proposition centered on reducing operational overhead. They promise simplified management, seamless cloud-native scalability, integrated security using familiar cloud primitives like AWS IAM, and a suite of advanced features like machine learning integrations, anomaly detection, and powerful visualization dashboards available "out-of-the-box".

For an organization struggling with the complexity of self-managing a SolrCloud cluster, patching security vulnerabilities, and managing ZooKeeper, the appeal of offloading these responsibilities to a cloud provider is immense. The migration path from a self-hosted Solr cluster to a managed OpenSearch service is becoming a common modernization strategy. This represents a fundamental shift in the value proposition, from the "control and customizability" offered by Solr to the "focus on business logic and reduced TCO" offered by managed services. This shift is a primary driver of churn for Solr.

#### **Operational Pain Points at Scale**

Finally, while Solr is known to be highly scalable, users report significant operational pain points when managing it at a very large scale, which can lead to disaffection. One detailed account from a large-scale user described several undesirable behaviors with Solr's out-of-the-box autoscaling, including poor replica placement across availability zones that created dangerous topologies. This resulted in incidents where leader nodes became overloaded and crashed, or where the failure of one node led to a cascading failure of its replica due to high load. The team had to resort to writing their own management scripts to enforce safe cluster topologies, highlighting a significant gap in the platform's native capabilities.
  * This is anecdotal, not sure if this is applicable generally.

Confidence in the platform can also be eroded by bugs in core SolrCloud functionality. For example, a bug fixed in version 9.8.1 could cause PULL-type replicas to get stuck in a DOWN state indefinitely following long leader elections. These types of hard-to-diagnose production issues, which can cause data unavailability or require manual intervention to resolve, are a strong motivation for experienced teams to seek out alternatives that are perceived to be more stable or better supported at scale.

## **Concluding Analysis and Strategic Outlook**

Apache Solr enters the latter half of the 2020s as a powerful veteran in a market that has fundamentally changed around it. It is no longer the default open-source choice for search that it once was, having evolved into a more specialized, albeit highly capable, tool. Its trajectory is defined by the central tension between its profound core strengths and the significant operational and ecosystem headwinds that challenge its relevance.

The platform's future success appears to depend on its ability to execute a difficult dual strategy. First, it must **retain and nurture its core base**. This involves continuing to provide the stability, performance, and deep customizability that its loyal users depend on. The project's steady release cadence and the emergence of a commercial long-term support ecosystem are key assets in this effort. They allow enterprises to continue leveraging their deep investment in Solr with confidence, insulating them from the pressures of forced upgrades and security risks.

Second, and more critically, Solr must **attract a new generation of users** (**e.n. - a lot of agreement here**). This requires more than just adding new features; it requires fundamentally lowering the barriers to entry. The project's successful integration of vector search capabilities is a vital step, proving it can adapt to modern AI paradigms. However, this progress is undermined by persistent operational friction. To truly compete for new projects, Solr must aggressively address the complexity of its initial setup and management, particularly the dependency on ZooKeeper, and find a compelling answer to the integrated dashboarding and visualization tools of its rivals. This is as much a marketing and user experience challenge as it is a technical one.

For a technology leader in 2025, choosing Apache Solr is a deliberate and strategic decision. It is a choice for ultimate control, unparalleled customizability in text search, and the long-term safety of a truly open-source license. This choice is made with a clear understanding that it comes at the cost of higher operational overhead and a steeper learning curve compared to its main rivals. Solr remains a formidable, and often superior, choice for complex, text-heavy, and highly customized search applications. It has become, however, a difficult choice to justify for teams that prioritize speed of development, ease of use, and the simplicity of a managed, all-in-one data platform.
