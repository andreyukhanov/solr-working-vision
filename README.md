# Solr Working Vision

## Why a vision?
It's nice to have some consensus - or rather, an ongoing discussion towards a consensus - about where an OSS project is going.

This is good for:
* **Existing community**. To know if it alligns with their objectives and opinions. For example, is it worth contributing more or is it a waste of my time?
* **New people**. When choosing a technology, many people consider not only what it can currently do, but where it's going. For example, the features I'm interested in can be actively developed or look like unmaintained legacies.

## What is a vision?
Terminology can be different to different people, but for the purpose of this discussion, we need to differentiate mission, vision and roadmap:
* A **mission** is the general direction and is often open-ended. E.g., we're climbing the nicest mountains to enjoy the view.
* A **vision** is a long-term goal, achievable and measurable, but still concise and aspirational. E.g., we want to climb Kilimanjaro and experience all the climates.
* A **roadmap** is the list of detailed steps that get us to the vision. We need to find sponsors, buy tickets, train, etc.

## What do you mean by "working"?
It means it's not static. We want **iterations**. Because:
* It's **unlikely to get it right on the first try**. That is, have a vision that represents the Solr community as a whole.
* Even if we do, things change: both the community itself (users and contributors come and go) and its requirements (e.g., time-series analysis, vector search, agents...).

## "Working" process
We propose a progression of reflective questions. For each question:
* Each contributor provides input independently.
* Contributors then meet to discuss inputs towards some consensus.

Questions are divided in categories:

### A. Where Solr is Today [Factual]
1. Problem Domain - What is Solr's (Problem) Domain? What is Search Technology?
2. Current Offering - What Solr currently offers?
3. Current User Base - Who is using Solr?
4. Competitive Comparison - How does Solr compare to its alternatives?
### B. Where things may be going [Opinionated]
5. Domain Evolution - In Solr's Problem Domain, what is changing (shifting/evolving/happening)?
6. Attract & Retain / Deter & Disaffect - Who & Why - What is Solrâ€™s current ability to Attract & Retain and current tendency to Deter & Disaffect?
### C. Where we would like to see things go [Strategic]
7. Vision - What are the aspirational points on the Horizon worth pursuing?
8. Roadmap - What are the important work items that would get us there?

In our first iteration, we used additional ideas and inputs from LLMs to help us with our brainstorming. You'll find them... [TODO - separate folders? I would use one folder for each question, with the expansion of each question in the README and the LLM response in a sub-folder].

We also asked the community about various items related to 1-6 in a survey. We think the survey is also worth iterating on (like the vision does), so that it serves as a good feedback mechanism.

Lastly, we want to package the answers to 1-7 for each iteration and present them to the community, inviting discussions and further iterations&contributions. It's not the output itself that matters most, but the ongoing effort to allign the community and write down where we are and where we want to go.

## First iteration output
[TODO] I'd put here a ToC with the questions, and links from each question to a file with the group response to that question. All these files would go into an "output" folder. And then we can have one branch per year. Or should we have dated folders (e.g. 2025, 2026...)

## Contributing
[TODO] This is our call to action, where we invite people to contribute and sign themselves up for the next iteration. I don't have a clear idea now about how this should look like - any suggestions are welcome. I assume we'll also want to put the output on solr.apache.org somewhere, during an iteration where we feel like this is representative enough for the whole community.
